correlation between maternal and fetal plasma levels of glucose and free
fatty acids .                                                           
  correlation coefficients have been determined between the levels of   
glucose and ffa in maternal and fetal plasma collected at delivery .    
significant correlations were obtained between the maternal and fetal   
glucose levels and the maternal and fetal ffa levels . from the size of 
the correlation coefficients and the slopes of regression lines it      
appears that the fetal plasma glucose level at delivery is very strongly
dependent upon the maternal level whereas the fetal ffa level at        
delivery is only slightly dependent upon the maternal level .

changes of the nucleic acid and phospholipid levels of the livers in the
course of fetal and postnatal development .                             
  we have followed the evolution of dna, rna and pl in the livers of rat
foeti removed between the fifteenth and the twenty-first day of         
gestation and of young rats newly-born or at weaning . we can observe   
the following facts..                                                   
  1. dna concentration is 1100 ug p on the 15th day, it decreases from  
the 19th day until it reaches a value of 280 ug 5 days after weaning .  
  2. rna concentration is 1400 ug p on the 15th day and decreases to 820
during the same period .                                                
  3. pl concentration is low on the 15th day and during foetal life (700
ug) and increases abruptly at birth .                                   
  4. the ratios rna cyto/dna and pl cyto/dna increase regularly from the
18th day of foetal life .                                               
  5. nuclear rna and pl contents are very high throughout the           
development .                                                           
  6. these results enable us to characterize three stages in the        
development of the rat liver.. - from the 15th day to the 18th day of   
foetal life.. stage of growth through hyperplasia without hypertrophy,  
  - from the 19th day of foetal life to the 3rd day of post-natal life,.
stage of cellular reorganisation,                                       
  - after the 3rd day of post-natal life.. stage of growth through      
hyperplasia and hypertrophy .

surfactant in fetal lamb tracheal fluid .                               
  lambs delivered by cesarean section with intact fetal circulation have
a fluid filling the trachea . analysis revealed that this fluid         
contained material high in surface activity in lambs delivered near     
term, but less surface activity in premature lambs .                    
  administration of 10 per cent oxygen to the ewe for 1 hour prior to   
delivery did not alter the surfactant properties of the fetal tracheal  
fluid .                                                                 
  two analyses of the fetal tracheal fluid revealed it to contain 146   
and 198 mg. of lipid per 100 ml., 30 to 40 per cent of which was        
phospholipid, part of the active component of surfactant .              
  the investigations reported here offer a model for further research   
into possible intrauterine factors in the pathogenesis of hyaline       
membrane disease .

placental and cord blood lipids.. comparison in a set of double ovum    
twins, a stillborn and a live-born .                                    
  1. determinations of phospholipid, total and free cholesterol,        
triglyceride and nefa have been made on placental tissue and cord blood 
in a set of double ovum twins, one stillborn and one live-born .        
  2. similarities occurred in all fractions studied except the cord     
blood triglyceride and nefa levels .                                    
  3. the serum of the stillborn infant contained one-third as much      
triglyceride and 21/2 times as much nefa as did the live-born infant .  
  4. the phospholipid content and the total lipid content of the        
stillbirth placenta were the highest studied in this laboratory which   
includes determinations on 26 live births .                             
  5. the suggestion is made that increased lipoprotein lipase activity  
in the cord blood may accompany intrauterine fetal death .

free fatty acid concentration in maternal plasma and fetal body fat     
content .                                                               
  subcutaneous injection of 200 u.s.p. units of heparin into female     
sprague-dawley rats produced large and sustained elevations of plasma   
free fatty acids but no significant change in blood glucose . a group of
pregnant rats received such injections of heparin 3 times daily         
throughout pregnancy . the fetuses from mothers of this group, at 191/2 
and 211/2 days of gestation, had significantly more body fat than the   
fetuses from uninjected mothers . the hypothesis is presented that the  
maternal free fatty acid concentration in part determines fetal fat     
accumulation . it is proposed that the body composition changes noted in
babies of mothers with diabetes might thus be ascribed to abnormally    
high maternal plasma free fatty acid concentrations .

the concentration of non-esterified fatty acids in maternal and fetal   
plasma in intact, alloxan-diabetic and x-ray-irradiated rats .          
  determinations of the non-esterified fatty acids in the plasma of     
pregnant rats showed that there do not exist any increases in the       
concentrations depending on pregnancy during the period from the 20th - 
22nd day of pregnancy . in the fetal plasma the concentrations of       
non-esterified fatty acids only amounted to 40 - 50 per cent of the     
maternal values .                                                       
  with alloxan diabetes produced 2 days prior to the test the           
concentration in the maternal plasma increased three- to fivefold, while
at the same time a significant rise was absent in fetal plasma with     
slightly increased average values .                                     
  whole-body x-ray exposures (dose.. 400r, dose output.. 40r/min) of    
non-pregnant female and of pregnant rats beginning on the 17th day of   
pregnancy did not result in any changes of the concentration of         
non-esterified fatty acids immediately after irradiation .

lipid metabolism in toxemia and normal pregnancy .                      
  the amount and fatty acid composition of total lipid extract from     
serum were examined in normal pregnant women in the first, second, and  
third trimesters, and early postpartum period, and in patients with mild
and severe preeclampsia and with essential hypertension . placentas at  
term were also examined for total lipid and its fatty acid composition .
in the normal women, total serum lipid increased during pregnancy . the 
rise was less pronounced in those with preeclampsia or hypertension .   
serum palmitate was mildly but significantly elevated in preeclampsia . 
total lipid and arachidonic acid were elevated in the placentas of      
preeclamptic women . the findings are compared with those obtained from 
animals developing eclampsia on an experimental basis .

essential fatty acids and acids with trans-configuration in the         
subcutaneous and visceral fat of the newborn .                          
  we made an investigation of the subcutaneous and visceral fat in the  
newborn . we estimated the contents of linolic and linolenic acid and of
acids with trans-configuration spectrophotometrically .                 
  we were able to show the penetration of these acids through the       
placental barrier . the essential fatty acid contents of fat in the     
newborn is low . in immature ones about 7-14 g, there is a rising trend.

acetoacetate formation by livers from human fetuses aged 8-17 weeks .   
  slices and homogenates from livers of human fetuses aged 8-17 weeks   
have a low rate of acetoacetate formation which can be raised by        
addition of acetate or octanoate to the incubation medium . it was not  
possible to demonstrate acetoacetate formation by isolated liver        
mitochondria from 17-week-old fetuses, probably because mitochondria are
injured during isolation .

changes in blood glucose and non-esterified fatty acids in the foetal

  changes in blood glucose and non-esterified fatty acids after         
intravenous adrenaline were measured in foetal, newborn and adult sheep 
in the foetus and immediately after birth there was very little       
increase in either blood glucose or non-esterified fatty acids after    
adrenaline . the response of blood glucose to adrenaline had reached    
adult levels at twenty-four hours of age . the response of non-esterifi-
ed fatty acids to adrenaline increased gradually over the first week .

electron-microscopic observatations on transference of fat through the  
human placenta .                                                        
  from the results of our previous and present studied on the           
transportation of fat through the human placenta by means of electron   
microscopy, we obtained the following conclusions .                     
  1) neutral fat can permeate through the human placenta without        
dissociation .                                                          
  2) almost all processes of fat permeation seem to be due to the       
biological activity . pinocytosis is most representative, but the       
authors newly found several facts such as dissolution-like change in the
basement membrane and transport via the stroma cell . the authors       
believe that these results will bring a clue to explain the mechanism of
biological transportation of materials through the placenta .

the content of phosphatides, triglycerides and cholesterol in placentas,
maternal, fetal and new-born liver of the white rat .                   
  thin-layer-chromatographic examinations in the maternal rat liver     
showed different rise of the triglycerides and a significant increase of
the esterified cholesterol, however, no striking changes in the content 
of free cholesterol and lipid phosphorus with the fractions examined    
(lecithin, colamine cephalin, sphingomyelin and lysolecithin) .         
  as compared to the liver of adult rats, the fetal liver contains a    
little less than 50 per cent lipid phosphorus . the difference is       
conditioned by the concentrations of lecithin, and colamine cephalin .  
on the 19th day the content of triglycerides is lower than in the mother
rat . referred to the dry weight, there results a decrease of all       
phosphatide fractions, as well as of the free cholesterol and a slight  
rise of the triglycerides from the 19th to the 22nd day .               
  the rise of the phosphatide concentrations to the values of adult rats
occurs immediately after birth under the influence of milk food, which, 
moreover, leads to a considerable increase of the triglyceride values . 
phospholipid- and triglyceride concentrations of the placenta correspond
to those of the fetal liver . solely the content of free cholesterol is 
higher at the end of pregnancy . the content of triglyceride drops      
towards the 22nd day .

analysis of mammalian lens proteins by electrophoresis .                
  lens proteins of different mammalian species were analyzed by         
two-dimensional starch gel electrophoresis . the number of fractions    
detected by this means varied from 11-20 . a-crystallin was resolved    
into two to three components, b-crystallin into 5-11, and y-crystallin  
into three to five components . this technique provides a sensitive     
method for the fractionation of lens proteins and for analyzing species 
differences .

an autoradiographic study on cell migration in the eye lens epithelium  
from normal and alloxan diabetic rats .                                 
  lenses from normal and alloxan diabetic rats with and without cataract
were investigated by autoradiography 4 hours, 4 days and 8 days after an
intraperitoneal injection of h3-thymidine (0.4 uc/g body weight) . the  
rats were made diabetic 8 days prior to the injection of thymidine at an
age of 4 weeks . the position of labelled nuclei of the lens epithelium 
was noted and their grain numbers counted . the diabetic rats had a     
lower frequency of labelled nuclei than the controls but after 4 hours  
their grain counts were equal . frequency diagrams of labelled nuclei   
are given for each of the three experimental periods . a predominant    
peak appears after 4 hours at a distance of 30-60 cells in front of the 
beginning of the nuclear arc . a successive shift towards this area was 
observed for the longer experimental periods . the shift of the peaks   
was more restricted in the diabetic animals . this result may best be   
interpreted as an effect of an increased time of cell generation .      
  as an appendix a histotechnique for the eye lens is given in          
collaboration with mrs. gertraude moewis .

lens development.. the differentiation of embryonic chick lens          
epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo .                                 
  the behavior of lens epithelial cells from six-day chick embryos was  
studied in three different experimental situations.. (a) explantation   
into several different fluid culture media, (b) explantation followed by
reimplantation into lensectomized embryonic eyes, and (c) explantation  
followed by reimplantation into the embryonic coelomic cavity .         
specimens were examined histologically, and the total volume of the lens
material of each specimen was determined from the planimetry of serial  
sections . the results were interpreted as follows..                    
  1. with a small amount of protein supplement in the culture medium,   
embryonic lens epithelial cells are capable of a limited amount of      
independent cytodifferentiation . without protein supplement they fail  
to undergo any fiber formation .                                        
  2. when returned to the eye environment, cultured epithelial explants 
will respond with a resumption of growth, with further cellular         
differentiation, and with at least some of the morphogenetic changes    
necessary to form a lens . the embryonic coelom will not support these  
responses .                                                             
  3. the initiation of the formation of lens fibers is not sufficient   
for their complete autonomous maturation .                              
  4. the internal architecture of the developing lens is not the only   
determinant of its overall shape .

treatment of active chronic hepatitis and lupoid hepatitis with         
6-mercaptopurine and azothioprine .                                     
  6-mercaptopurine or azothioprine ('imuran') was used successfully in 3
patients with active chronic hepatitis and 2 with lupoid hepatitis, for 
periods up to 1 year . these drugs allowed modification and even        
abolition of discomforting corticosteroid regimes . their action in     
chronic hepatitis may be analogous to their anti-immune action in       
suppressing homograft rejection .

was obtained in 17 patients,. and, in 20 out of 22 patients who had been
on long-term glucocorticoid medication, the steroid therapy could be    
permanently discontinued . serious complications occurred, in the form  
of two deaths from pancytopenia and sepsis . the treatment requires

  two cases of systemic lupus erythematosus along with terminal uremia  
secondary to lupus nephritis are presented . both patients were treated 
with renal hemodialysis and transplantation . certain mechanical,       
infectious, and immunologic problems were responsible for their death . 
there was no evidence of resurgence of lupus erythematosus in either    
patient, and the transplanted kidneys did not show evidence of lupus    
nephritis . renal transplantation should be considered as a last resort 
in treatment of patients with terminal lupus nephritis .

renal amyloidosis a clinicopathological study .                         
  the clinical and histopathological data from 40 cases of renal        
amyloidosis diagnosed by percutaneous renal biopsy are presented .      
  twenty-two cases were labelled as 'secondary' amyloidosis, as definite
aetiological factors responsible for renal amyloidosis could be         
discovered . the predisposing disease states leading to amyloid deposits
in the kidney in the order of frequency were fibrocaseous pulmonary     
tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, lung abscess, and ileocaecal tuberculosis 
five cases were labelled as suspected 'primary' amyloidosis as a      
definite evidence of the predisposing disease could not be obtained     
although the skiagram of chest revealed minimal healed foci . no cause  
could be determined in thirteen cases, which were, therefore, labelled  
as 'primary' amyloidosis .                                              
  albuminuria was a constant feature in all the cases and 32 cases      
presented as nephrotic syndrome . the rest of the cases presented with  
hypertension or renal failure in addition to albuminuria .              
  the ancillary procedure, viz., congo-red test, gingival and liver     
biopsies proved to be of limited value in the diagnosis of renal

  a case is reported of a sixty-nine year old woman with severe,        
idiopathic, autoimmune hemolytic anemia which was initially controlled  
by splenectomy . a relapse associated with the development of severe,   
autoimmune, thrombocytopenic purpura failed to respond to large doses of
prednisone, but was controlled to a variable degree with imuran .       
  associated features included diffuse hypergammaglobulinemia, excessive
gamma-u proteins in the urine, idiopathic hypoalbuminemia with a greatly
reduced total exchangeable albumin pool, amyloidosis in the spleen and  
other organs, and diffuse plasmacytosis of the bone marrow, lymph nodes,
and thoracic and peritoneal fat . these features and their              
interrelationships are discussed . there was no deficiency in the       
synthesis of specific neutralizing antibodies against viruses,

corticosteroid therapy of amyloid nephrotic syndrome .                  
  the results of treatment with prolonged adrenal corticosteroids in 26 
adults with amyloid nephrotic syndrome are presented . eight subjects

survival after onset of the disease of 17.6 months . the renal disease  
was indistinguishable from that seen in other forms of the nephrotic    
syndrome, with the possible exceptions of (a) a high incidence of       
purpuric skin lesions, (b) a low or negligible incidence of hypertension
(at times actual hypotension was prominent), and (c) a rapid and        
inexorable progression of azotemia despite persistence of the clinical  
and biochemical characteristics of the nephrotic syndrome . amyloidosis 
was found by percutaneous renal biopsy in 12 per cent of 83 adults with 
the nephotic syndrome .                                                 
  corticosteroids did not appear to affect the progress of the disease  
and were neither beneficial nor detrimental . in view of the high       
incidence of deleterious side effects of prolonged corticosteroid       
therapy and the availability of potent diuretic agents which may be     
helpful in relieving edema in this disorder, it is felt that            
corticosteroids are contraindicated in the treatment of amyloid         
nephrotic syndrome .

renal amyloidosis.. a biopsy study .                                    
  the relationship of the amount of amyloid deposition in the kidney to 
the clinical picture is reviewed in 14 cases of renal amyloidosis       
diagnosed by renal biopsy . the large percentage of patients who had the
nephrotic syndrome (11 patients) probably reflects the criteria for     
renal biopsy at this institution . the etiology of the amyloid          
deposition did not seem to be clearly correlated with either the amount 
of amyloid deposition in the kidney or the severity of the clinical     
renal disease . all patients had deposits in the glomerulus, and the    
heavier the deposition the severer the renal disease . of 7 patients who
had biopsy of the bone marrow, all had abnormal types or numbers of     
plasma cells . the age range in primary amyloidosis appeared to be about
the same as that in amyloidosis secondary to myeloma . amyloidosis      
should be suspected in patients with proteinuria, the nephrotic         
syndrome, or renal failure .

from amyloid .                                                          
  proteins extracted by strong urea from washed tissue of patients with 
amyloidosis secondary to several diseases or associated with familial   
mediterranean fever have common major electrophoretic components . in   
hearts of primary amyloidosis one component in common with the secondary
amyloid may be present . however, primary amyloid is much more difficult
to dissolve and does not regularly give the components observed when the
secondary amyloid is extracted . the big question remains as to what    
constituent or constituents comprise the fibrils now known to be a part

selectivity of protein excretion in patients with the nephrotic syndrome.
  with a gel diffusion precipitin technique and commercially prepared   
antisera, urine/plasma ratios of specific proteins were determined .    
individual protein clearances, expressed as a percentage of transferrin 
clearance, were plotted as ordinates against respective molecular       
weights on a log-log graph . a straight line was evident graphically,   
its constants were estimated by the method of least squares, and the    
slope, expressed as , was determined . the slope of the line may be said
to express the degree of glomerular selectivity to protein excretion .  
sixty-five determinations were performed in 48 patients . 45 satisfying 
the usual criteria of the nephrotic syndrome .                          
  1) those patients with primary renal disease and the nephrotic        
syndrome who displayed high selectivity types of proteinuria ( greater  
than the average for the group + 1 sd) usually respond initially to     
steroid therapy, regardless of the acute or subacute glomerular changes 
observed on renal biopsy .                                              
  2) those patients with chronic renal disease and the nephrotic        
syndrome display an average and frequently a low selectivity type of    
proteinuria .                                                           
  3) there appears to be no characteristic type of selectivity for a    
given pathologic group of patients with the nephrotic syndrome .        
  4) the degree of selective protein excretion is not related to the    
total daily amount of protein being excreted at any one time and remains
fairly constant despite fluctuation in the amount of protein being      
excreted .                                                              
  5) there is a slight correlation of borderline significance between   
the degree of selective protein excretion and the duration of the       
disease, and the initial para-aminohippuric acid clearance .            
  6) a statistically significant correlation exists between the initial 
blood urea nitrogen or inulin clearance and the selectivity type of     
protein excretion . those patients who were not azotemic and had        
initially near-normal inulin clearances had an average selectivity type 
or better .                                                             
  7) it is suggested that if the adult patient is initially azotemic and
has a grossly abnormal inulin clearance, response to therapy is         
unlikely, whereas if the blood urea nitrogen is normal and the inulin   
clearance is near normal, response to therapy cannot be predicted with  
any degree of accuracy . further studies of adult patients with the     
nephrotic syndrome are required to substantiate this premise .

excretion patterns of urinary metabolites of estradiol-4-c14 in         
postmenopausal women with benign and malignant disease of the breast .  
  a study of the excretion patterns of the urinary metabolites of       
estradiol-4-c1j administered to a group of 43 postmenopausal women, 38  
with advanced mammary carcinoma prior to endocrine therapy and 5 with   
benign mammary dysplasia, is reported . a chromatographic method was    
employed for the determination of estradiol, estrone, and estriol and   
other estrogen metabolites . the urinary excretion pattern is defined by
(a) the extent of excretion of isotope in each of 3 successive 24-hr.   
collection periods, (b) the percentage of the urinary radiometabolites  
enzymatically hydrolyzed, (c) the relative concentration of the several 
metabolites in the hydrolyzed fraction . wide subject-to-subject        
variations were found . the metabolites other than estradiol, estrone,  
and estriol comprised a large portion of the total estrogens excreted . 
a significantly lower amount of estradiol was noted in the group of     
women with mammary carcinoma as compared to the amount found in the     
group of women with benign mammary dysplasia, suggesting that the former
group metabolizes more rapidly the administered estradiol . although the
excretion patterns of patients who failed to respond to estrogen        
treatment (nonresponders) differed the greatest from the patterns       
associated with benign disease, distinctive patterns of the urinary     
excretion of isotopic estrogens which allowed a statistically           
significant or clinically useful separation between responders and      
nonresponders to subsequent estrogen therapy were not discovered .

the development of social attachments in infancy .                      
  this report is devoted to the formation and development of social     
attachments in infancy . it is suggested that the core of the attachment
function is represented by the tendency of the young to seek the        
proximity of certain other members of the species and that the most     
suitable operational definition may be found in the behavior of the     
individual when deprived of such proximity .                            
  the study takes the form of a longitudinal follow-up, in which 60     
infants were investigated at four-weekly intervals from the early weeks 
on up to the end of the first year and again at 18 months of age . with 
the use of an attachment scale, based on seven everyday separation      
situations, the following three main parameters were explored.. the age 
at onset of specific attachments, the intensity of such attachments, and
the number of objects to whom attachments are formed . a measure of     
fear-of-strangers was also included .                                   
  results indicate that the age at onset of specific attachments is     
generally to be found in the third quarter of the first year, but that  
this is preceded by a phase of indiscriminate attachment behavior,. that
the intensity of specific attachment increases most in the first month  
following onset and that thereafter fluctuations occur in individual    
cases which make long-term prediction difficult,. and that multiplicity 
of objects can be found in some instances at the very beginning of the  
specific attachment phase, becoming the rule in most of the remaining   
cases very soon thereafter . correlations between the attachment        
variables, as well as with the fear-of-strangers measure, are presented,
and an examination is also made of the conditions eliciting protest at  
proximity loss, of the manner in which protest is expressed, and of the 
conditions necessary to terminate protest .                             
  individual differences with regard to the three main parameters were  
explored in a subgroup of 36 infants . a number of variables were       
examined in relation to these individual differences, and suggestions   
made regarding the conditions which affect the manifestation of the     
attachment function .                                                   
  the data are discussed in relation to four themes which emerged from  
the findings.. the nature of the attachment function, its developmental 
origins, its developmental trends, and the influence of the social      
setting .

separation anxiety as a cause of early emotional problems in children . 
  in summary, three cases of disturbed behavior in children have been   
discussed, with particular emphasis on disturbances in feeding,         
sleeping, and motility . some of the hypotheses have been presented of  
why such behavior should develop,. the significance of attachment       
behavior and separation anxiety in infants has been particularly        
stressed . difficulties in mothering care are threatening to the child's
sense of security and lead to greater experience of separation anxiety, 
which may then be reflected in various disturbances or alterations in   
his behavior . this experience of separation anxiety is the result of   
early life experience, may reach pathologic proportions, and may account
for many later problems in children and adults .

  chromatographic fractionations have been performed on the             
ultracentrifugal supernatants of homogenates of rat lung and liver by   
the use of columns of dextran gel (sephadex g-100) . a major proportion 
of nickel in these tissue supernatants has been demonstrated to be      
firmly bound to macromolecular constituents . following acute and       
chronic inhalation of carcinogenic levels of nickel carbonyl, the       
predominant increases in the concentrations of nickel have been observed
in the macromolecular fractions . these findings are consistent with the
previous demonstration of nickel in purified preparations of ribonucleic
acids (rna) from several rat tissues, and with the observation of       
increased concentrations of nickel in high-molecular weight rna from    
lung and liver following the inhalation of nickel carbonyl .

  1. ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid reversibly inhibits the

intradermal test using cobalt chloride .                                
  selected groups of patients with cobalt allergy and nickel allergy as 
well as normal controls were tested intradermally with cobalt chloride  
in the dilutions 10 to 10 . reactions of the wheal and flare type appear
during the first hours and make the 24-hour reading misleading . the    
papular response to cobalt chloride 10, when read 48 to 96 hours after  
the injection, appears to be a reliable test for cobalt allergy .       
patients with combined nickel-cobalt allergy were excluded from the     
study, and the question of group reactions is not discussed . nickel    
allergics give a somewhat stronger reaction than controls to the        
slightly impure cobalt chloride . it would be preferable if the degree  
of purity of the cobalt chloride were ten times greater .

measurements of nickel in biological materials by atomic absorption

  an atomic absorption procedure has been developed which facilitates   
quantitative measurements of nickel in biological materials, including  
urine, ribonucleic acids (rna), and serum proteins .                    
  the sensitivity of detection of nickel by the atomic absorption       
spectrometer (0.10 p.p.m.) was insufficient to permit direct            
measurements of nickel in normal urine . therefore, it was necessary to 
employ a dimethylglyoxime extraction procedure to concentrate the       
nickel, prior to atomic absorption spectrometry .                       
  the coefficients of variation of measurements of nickel in urine and  
human b- globulins were 6.3 and 5.9 per cent, respectively . the        
recovery of nickel added to urine averaged 96 per cent, with a range    
from 94 to 97, and the recovery of nickel added to human b-globulin     
averaged 101 per cent, with a range from 96 to 104 .                    
  the mean concentration of nickel in 24-hr. collections of urine from  
17 normal subjects was 1.8 ug. per 100 ml. (s.d. = 0.8), with a range   
from 0.4 to 3.1 . the mean urinary excretion of nickel was 19.8 ug. per 
24 hr. (s.d. = 10.0), with a range from 7.2 to 37.6 .                   
  the mean concentration of nickel in 5 preparations of ribonucleic     
acids from ultracentrifugal supernatants of homogenates of rat lung was 
48 ug. of ni per gm. of rna, with a range from 34 to 64 . the mean      
concentration of nickel in 5 preparations of rna from ultracentrifugal  
supernatants of homogenates of rat liver was 29 ug. of ni per gm. of    
rna, with a range from 21 to 39 .                                       
  measurements of nickel were performed upon fractions of human serum   
proteins, prepared by continuous-flow electrophoresis, and by

  the time course and extent of the methemoglobinemia induced by        
intraperitoneal sodium nitrite and p-aminopropiophenone (papp) have been
characterized in female mice . the peak methemoglobin formation (34 ) is
achieved in about 40 minutes . comparable levels from papp (15 mg/kg)   
are achieved more quickly (between 5 and 10 minutes) but decline more   
rapidly to normal . both nitrite- and papp-induced methemoglobinemia    
afford a significant degree of protection against poisoning by sodium   
azide when administered in an appropriate time sequence . it was not    
possible under the same circumstances to protect mice against death from
fluoride, cyanate, thiocyanate, selenate, or borate, although some      
prolongation of survival time was seen after fluoride . the formation of
the azide-methemoglobin complex has been demonstrated within intact     
mouse red blood cells, and small amounts of the complex were identified 
in vivo in an antidotal situation . we think it important that the      
protective action of methemoglobinemia has been demonstrated to date    
only against established inhibitors of cytochrome oxidase .

highest level of sulfur-35 (1600 uc) injected into eggs containing 4-day
embryos produced morphological abnormalities more severe than those     
produced by the same level of radiosulfur administered to 8-day embryos,
or by any level of stable selenium tolerated . selenium at levels       
greater than 30 ug killed all the embryos within 24 hours after         
injection . nearly 20 times more tellurium than selenium was required to
kill all the embryos within 24 hours.. no abnormalities were observed in
the tellurium-injected embryos .

the effect of selenium on the upper respiratory passages .              
  results are reported of examination of workers exposed to selenium,   
with special reference to chronic changes in the respiratory passages . 
the findings are the same as reported in the literature . we emphasize  
the occurrence of teleangiectasias on the uvula and on the posterior    
palatinal arcs and on the epiglotis . we describe the occurrence of the 
first poisoning with selenium xyde in this country . the poisoning      
healed within a few days under symptomatic treatment . the patient had  
however to be transferred into another shop owing to frequent symptoms  
due to toxic effect of selenium . we report also on secondary findings  
in examination of chronic changes and we emphasize particularly the     
finding of profesional selenium external otitis .

the influence of small selenite doses upon the toxic fatty degeneration 
of the liver .                                                          
  sodium selenite (10 ug/kg) manifests a lipotropic effect after        
toxication of the rat by tetrachlorocarbon . this effect is absent when 
the selenite dose is increased to 50 ug/kg . the level of the total     
lipides of the liver after ethionine toxication is not significantly    
influenced by 10 ug selenite/kg . it is increased by 50 ug selenite/kg.

selenium-caused tumours .                                               
  in 10 out of 23 heterozygous rats administered 10 mg na seo per 1 kg  
food (containing 12 protein) and surviving for 18 months, cancer of the 
liver (with metastases in the lungs) along with sarcoma and adenoma was 
recorded . in another series of the yet incompleted experiment the      
animals were fed higher quantities of protein and selenium . toward     
14-19 months in three of them sarcoma was noted.. in two sarcoma of the 
lymphatic nodes, and in one- of the mediastinum .                       
  it is suggested that the changes caused by selenium compounds are to  
some extent due to their antagonistic relationship with methionine .

ehrlich ascites tumor cells agglutination.. the interference exerted by 
epsilonaminocaproic acid (eac) and its acetyl derivative (eaca) .       
  the activity of epsilon-aminocaproic acid (eac) and of its acetyl     
derivative (eaca) was studied on antigen-antibody reactions, membrane   
antigens and immune globulins .                                         
  in vitro eac and eaca do not affect immune globulins, but they do     
alter the membrane antigens of ehrlich ascites tumor cells and inhibit  
the agglutination reaction induced by a specific antiserum . inhibition 
is only partially due to the antigenic alteration observed, and it      
represents more prominently a direct interference at the level of the   
antigen-antibody reaction .                                             
  the membrane antigen alternations induced by the drugs and by nitrogen
mustard were compared, taking into account their toxicity.. eac and eaca

current status of hypothermia .                                         
  moderate hypothermia has been recommended for many and varied         
conditions . today its value is being questioned in the light of        
controlled groups of patients . at the moment its use is justified in   
certain cardiac and other operations where circulation may be           
interrupted for short periods.. in general surgical procedures where    
massive, sudden blood loss may be anticipated.. in neurosurgical        
operations where a /relaxed/ brain is required.. following acute hypoxia
such as seen in cardiac arrest.. and perhaps in the therapy of acute    
septicemic shock .                                                      
  profound hypothermia in association with extracorporeal circulation   
rests on shakier premises, but can be of value in major cardiac         
operations where asystole is required and in certain neurosurgical      
procedures where complete interruption of circulation is indicated .    
  there is a great hazard in the development of inadvertent or          
unrecognized hypothermia in the anesthetized patient . monitoring of    
body temperature is an important feature of the care of the patient in  
the operating theater and in the recovery room .

hyperglycemic coronary perfusion.. effect of hypothermia on myocardial  
function during cardiopulmonary bypass .                                
  in a series of 84 animal experiments hyperglycemic perfusion of the   
heart gave significant protection to the anoxic heart . this protection 
was evaluated by ventricular function and contractile force studies and 
was observed after aortic occlusion at 37, 28 and 10 degrees c .        
  metabolic data revealed a considerable myocardial glucose uptake,     
higher coronary ph, higher po and lower pco in the glucose-perfused     
groups as compared to controls .                                        
  a hypothesis for the protective effect may be an alteration in        
metabolic pathway and support of the myocardial enzyme systems          
associated with high glucose concentration and utilization .

specific carcinoembryonic antigens of the human digestive system .      
  a wide variety of human adult and fetal tissues were studied by       
immunodiffusion techniques in agar gel to determine whether they        
contained the tumor-specific antigen(s) previously found in colonic     
cancers . in the adult tissues it was demonstrated that identical       
antigens were present in all tested specimens of malignant tumors of the
entodermally derived epithelium of the gastro-intestinal tract and      
pancreas, but were absent from all other tested adult tissues . the     
common antigenic constituents, therefore, represent system-specific     
cancer antigens of the human digestive system . system-specific cancer  
antigens have not previously been demonstrated in humans .              
  experiments with fetal tissues demonstrated that identical antigens   
were also present in fetal gut, liver, and pancreas between 2 and 6     
months of gestation . these components were named /carcinoembryonic/    
antigens of the human digestive system . on the basis of the present    
findings and the recent work regarding control of the expression of     
genetic potentialities in various genetic potentialities in various     
types of cells, it was concluded that the carcinoembryonic antigens     
represent cellular constituents which are repressed during the course of
differentiation of the normal digestive system epithelium and reappear  
in the corresponding malignant cells by a process of                    
derepressive-dedifferentiation .

shown in the lungs and liver of mice infected with the pr 8 strain . the

comparative bone marrow study using two aspiration needles and two      
biopsy sites .                                                          
  bone marrow aspiration is now widely used in the diagnosis of         
hematologic diseases and many conditions not primarily affecting the    
blood system . a number of techniques have been devised by which a      
suitable specimen of marrow can be obtained with relatively little      
discomfort to the patient . the two needle sets described in this paper 
have been found to be equally reliable in obtaining bone marrow for     
microscopic study and diagnosis . comparative studies of bone marrow    
aspirated simultaneously from the iliac crest and the sternum in 26     
patients show no significant difference . however, there were four      
instances of dry tap at the iliac site . this fact, in addition to the  
observation that less discomfort was experienced by the patient when the
sternum was used, might indicate that the sternal area is a more        
reliable and efficient site for obtaining bone marrow .                 
  it was also observed during this study that patients experienced less 
discomfort when the university of illinois needle was used . the major  
objection to the use of this needle is the inability to obtain a bone   
core for biopsy .

  the depressing effect of dehydroepiandrosterone on plasma             
corticosteroids is, on an average, shortened in advanced breast cancer  
(stage iv) . the lowest corticosteroid values have been found with the  
three groups of patients 6 hours after infusion of                      
dehydroepiandrosterone phosphate . the effect of dehydroepiandrosterone 
being, still provable after 12 hours with the group suffering from      
mastopathy, the breast cancer group of stage iv had at this time already
reached the level of the initial values . the breast cancer group of    
stage iv had at this time already reached the level of the initial      
values . the breast cancer group of stage i/ii behaved intermediately . 
the less lasting effect of dehydroepiandrosterone is attributed to its  
accelerated transformation in advanced breast cancer .

the meaning of ph at low temperatures during extra-corporeal circulation
  a review of the temperature gradients occurring during profound       
hypothermia is made in regard to acid base changes in general, and to ph
readings in particular . it is concluded that terms such as 'body',     
'mean', 'average' and 'core' temperature should be discarded and that   
when a temperature is quoted it should be referred to the site at which 
it was measured .                                                       
  the main circumstances in which blood ph is measured at a temperature 
different from that at which the blood is equilibrated with respiratory 
gases are reviewed by describing the changes which occur during         
tonometry experiments . in this way fundamental changes can be          
understood before considering the more complicated sequences of events  
taking place in the living body .                                       
  the alterations that occur in the concentrations of protein and       
bicarbonate ion when whole blood is cooled are reviewed, together with  
their influence on 'correction factors' . the reasons why these factors 
should not be applied to blood when the living body is undergoing       
hypothermia involving the use of an extra-corporeal circulation are     
discussed .                                                             
  examples of the numerical values for blood ph during the two main     
methods for producing profound hypothermia, one using autogenous lung   
perfusion and the other a pump-oxygenator are given, with reference to  
the influence of pco2 upon these values .                               
  the existing methods of acid-base measurement appear to be            
sufficiently accurate to reflect the metabolic component during profound
hypothermia .

  the human sarcoma hs has been grown in weanling rats treated with     
cortisone . this growth was modified by prior injection of various      
tissue antigens . active /immunity/ was produced by using human placenta
or embryonic tissue as antigen, and similar results were obtained using 
suspensions of rapidly growing human tumours .                          
  the response to other human tissues varied.. foetal muscle and spleen 
were active, whereas adult plasma was inactive except from some patients
with extensive malignant disease .                                      
  passive protection was produced by using certain human sera at the    
time of challenging with hs . sera from five women who aborted showed   
this characteristic . where the pregnancy continued to term,            
antisubstances were not found,. and they were present in the puerperium 
in only two out of fifty cases .                                        
  further groups of rats were given rat embryonic tissues as antigen,   
and the tumour challenge was then made with walker tumour,. the results 
were variable .                                                         
  with a benzpyrene-induced tumour in a pure line of /wag/ rat the      
effect was not obtained except in isolated cases .                      
  in experiments in mice, using as challenge an irondextran induced     
mouse sarcoma, prior injection with embryonic mouse liver or placenta   
increased the resistance to the growth of the tumour, but the tumour has
not as yet been produced in a pure-line mouse . on the other hand mouse 
experiments, using as challenge the crocker tumour, proved negative .   
  it is suggested that immune reactions may play a part in causing some 
abortions .

  a clinical trial has been carried out to test the use of the          
discriminant in assessing the suitability of patients with advanced     
breast cancer for hypophysectomy or adrenalectomy .

  it has been shown that glucosamine-1- c administered intravenously to 
fed rats is rapidly removed from the blood stream and appears first as  
trichloroacetic acid-soluble derivatives in the tissues . this is       
followed by a conversion to macromolecules . at least 80 of the         
administered compound can be recovered in tissues . the liver is by far 
the most active organ in accumulating glucosamine . this is rapidly     
converted to protein-bound components of the liver particulate fraction 
(microsomes and mitochondria) and is then released to the plasma without
appreciable accumulation in the soluble proteins of the liver . it is   
concluded that the glucosamine is transferred to the peptide chains of  
glycoproteins at some stage before these proteins are released from the

  1. light microscopic observations on the development of the rat lung

  2. these same three stages can be identified by electron microscopy   
and all may be present in different parts of the lung at one time, e.g. 
at 40 and 45 mm. c.r. length .                                          
  3. in the glandular stage, the lung tissue itself has an immature     
appearance by light microscopy and by electron microscopy individual    
cells also are immature in respect of organelles . glycogen is present  
in immature cells .

  5. throughout all stages of development, the 'duct' or 'air' spaces   
are always lined by a continuous and complete epithelium, and blood     
vessels by a complete endothelium .

  7. micropinocytotic vesicles are present in large numbers in both

electron microscopy . mice were inoculated with 1.5 ld of pr8 influenza 
virus and killed at varying intervals after inoculation . observations  
by light microscopy were correlated with those by electron microscopy in
order to evaluate the lesions produced .                                
  at the periphery, the earliest lesions were focal areas of edema of   
alveolar lining cells, the capillary endothelium and the interposed     
basement membrane . this caused an appreciable thickening of the        
blood-air pathway . hypertrophy, degeneration and desquamation of the   
alveolar lining and proliferation of alveolar macrophages resulted in   
complete consolidation, which was progressive up to 1 week after        
infection .                                                             
  the central areas of the lung were affected somewhat differently . at 
3 days after infection, the nonciliated bronchiolar cells showed        
considerable hyperplasia of endoplasmic reticulum and apical cytoplasmic
edema . viral particles matured at the lumen surface of these cells and 
were then released into the bronchiolar lumen . the bronchiolar cells,  
both ciliated and nonciliated, underwent degeneration and sloughed into 
the bronchiolar lumen . the regenerating epithelium was stratified, and 
the surface cells were elongated and flattened . the peribronchiolar    
interstitial tissue gradually became totally infiltrated by cells,      
mostly of the mononuclear type .

studies on aging with horse crystalline lens gel as a contribution to   
biomorphosis of the mammalian crystalline lens .                        
  the effects of biomorphosis -dash the continuous material change in   
the chemical composition of the organs and tissues -dash are studied on 
the horse crystalline lens in respect of its amino acid content subject 
to substantial variations in the course of life . it is shown by        
electrophoretic and paperchromatographic methods that the qualitative   
composition of horse crystalline lenses remains quite the same, but that
within the individual age stages there occur quantitative variations    
between the individual amino acids .

the role of alveolar inclusion bodies in the developing lung .          
  the developing alveolar epithelium of man and rat contains            
characteristic inclusion bodies which are heterogeneous structures but  
basically consist of a system of membranous profiles and a limiting     
membrane of the unit type .                                             
  inclusion bodies appear to result from focal cytoplasmic degradation  
which occurs in the rapidly changing cuboidal alveolar epithelium . some
inclusion bodies in the developing rat lung are similar to the so-called
/lamellar transformed mitochondria./ however, evidence is presented     
suggesting that alteration of all cytoplasmic membranes may be involved 
in the process of inclusion body formation . certain images associated  
with the golgi complex are interpreted as early forms of inclusion      
bodies . there is also evidence that inclusion bodies enlarge by        
accretion of membranes which finally are extruded into the alveolar     
space . inclusion bodies are formed and /secreted/ in greater number    
late in fetal life and in early infancy, i.e., at the time when the     
cuboidal alveolar epithelium is differentiating to the mature flattened 
type . the latter contains no inclusion bodies .                        
  on the basis of the morphologic characteristics of the inclusion      
bodies and the distribution of the acid phosphatase reaction, it is     
concluded that inclusion bodies are lysosomal structures active during  
remodeling of the developing alveolar epithelium .                      
  the possible interrelationship of inclusion bodies and pulmonary      
surfactant is discussed .

postural changes in blood distribution and its relation to the change in
cardiac output .                                                        
  (1) cardiac output and the blood content indices of the several parts 
of the body were measured in 18 subjects including patients with various
diseases using external radioisotope counting techniques . changes in   
these 2 parameters induced by standing were compared with each other .  
  (2) average changes in blood distribution produced by standing were as
follows . decrease in blood content in the /lung/ (-25 ) and in the     
/heart/ (-26 ) and increase in the /thigh/ (+56 ) were statistically    
significant . no significant change was revealed in the /head/, /palm/, 
/liver/ and /abdomen/ .                                                 
  (3) cardiac output and stroke volume decreased by standing in most of 
the cases . recent data were added to those reported previously and were
treated statistically . average decrease in cardiac output was -13 in 6 
control cases, -35 in 16 cases with neurocirculatory asthenia and -35 in
10 cases with hyperthyroidism . the difference was significant between  
control and neurocirculatory asthenia . standing induced a substantial  
increase in cardiac output in a case of idiopathic nodal rhythm,        
although there remains a doubt whether it is the ordinary response in   
this disease .                                                          
  (4) significant linear correlation was revealed between per cent      
change of blood content in the /thigh/ or in the /lung/ and that of     
cardiac output or stroke volume induced by standing . minimal blood     
shift was observed when the latter was extreme, and vice versa . this   
implies as follows.. reactivity of the heart might be influenced by     
posture, and transmural pressure of veins and or capillaries is probably
adjusted, as in arterioles, to compensate for changes in cardiac output

comparative studies of the glycogen content of heart, liver and brain   
before and after iodine treatment and under conditions of asphyxia .    
  blood sugar level and glycogen concentration in the heart, brain and  
liver of rabbits after treatment with inorganic iodine, depot insulin,  
iodine and insulin combined, hostacortine and hostacortine and iodine   
combined are being examined . a control group remains untreated . in a  
second test series the glycogen determination under asphyxia (the       
trachea is being pinched off for three minutes) is repeated .           
  contrary to the brain the glycogen content of the heart muscle is not 
dependent upon the blood sugar level . after iodine treatment a lowering
of the blood sugar becomes noticeable, but also an increase in heart    
glycogen . the liver glycogen shows greater variations . the levels     
achieved in these test series therefore show no significant differences 
during asphyxia there is a significant lowering of glycogen in all    
three organs . preliminary treatment with iodine succeeds in stopping   
the lowering of glycogen in the heart muscle and the brain . the        
possible causes for this phenomenon are being discussed .

altered immunologic activity in sarcoidosis .                           
  studies in 16 patients with sarcoidosis revealed evidence of          
immunologic alterations other than impaired delayed hypersensitivity .  
transient impairment of the response of lymphocytes cultured from       
patients with sarcoidosis to phytohemagglutinin stimulation was found to
parallel the clinical severity of the disease . the hemolytic activity  
of serum complement was increased . a disproportionate increase in serum
iga was found characteristic of the hyperglobulinemia of sarcoidosis .  
these observations indicate that an altered immune response may be      
important in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis . a simple hypothesis as to
the specific kind of interaction of infectious agent and immunity which 
might result in the immunologic alterations observed is formulated and  
presented .

electron microscopy of cytoplasmic inclusions within /macrophages/ of   
human tissue .                                                          
  the fine structure of inclusions found within the cytoplasm of        
macrophages of human lung, spleen, skin, lymph node, and rectum has been
described .                                                             
  the inclusions appear as concentric or whorled lamellae arranged      
around a core . each lamella is constructed of discrete, parallel       
filaments . the inclusions do not resemble currently described viruses  
or virus-like particles, nor do they resemble asbestos bodies or other  
known atmospheric pollutants or ingestants .                            
  there is some resemblance to lipid phase systems as well as mast cell 
granules,. possibly the inclusions represent partial intracellular      
digestion of phagocytized tissue membranes or ingested mast cell        
granules, respectively . differences and similarities exist between the 
inclusion bodies of macrophages and the granules of mast cells . such   
variations could be due to alterations in mast cell granule morphology  
before or after macrophage ingestion .                                  
  cytologic distinctions between macrophages laden with mast cell       
granules and mast cells proper, remains obscure and requires additional 
experimental evidence for clear electron microscopic differentiation of 
these two cell types .

histological research on the lens in condition of hypoxia, changes in

epithelium was studied in 24 rats of the same strain and weight . the   
hypoxia was obtained in the decompression chamber .                     
  the results show that the mitotic activity of the lens epithelium is  
depressed at any of the examined altitudes (6.500, 8.000, 9.500 m),. in 
particular, a marked reduction in the number of the prophases and an    
accumulation in metaphase was observed .                                
  the results were examined from the statistical standpoint and

rate of change of carbon dioxide tension in arterial blood, jugular

administration .                                                        
  1. the rate of change of p in arterial blood and cisternal c.s.f., was
measured following 5 percent co administration in eight anaesthetized   
patients undergoing routine air encephalography . ventilation was       
maintained constant throughout the procedure by a respirator . in three 
of the experiments the rate of change of p in the jugular venous blood  
was also measured .                                                     
  2. the rise in p varied between 25.7 and 14.8 mm hg . the final       
samples of blood and c.s.f. were taken 20-25 min after the start of co  
administration in five experiments . at this time the mean rise in p was
65.9 (maximum range 68.1-61.6 percent) of the rise in p . in the        
remaining three experiments the final samples were taken at 15 min when 
the rises in p were 53.2, 39.4 and 38.1 percent of the arterial change .
  3. the increases in p were 57.5, 76.2 and 76.1 percent of those in the
arterial blood . the changes in p in the c.s.f. were smaller than in the
jugular venous blood in all three experiments . in two of the           
experiments the final samples were taken 15 min after the start of co   
administration when the increases of p in the c.s.f. were 68.5 percent  
and 50 percent of those in jugular venous blood . in one experiment     
where the final samples were taken at 20 min the increase in p was 89   
percent of the rise in p .                                              
  4. there was a delay, following the start of co administration, in the
rise of p in jugular venous blood and in the c.s.f . this delay was     
about 1 min in the jugular venous blood but in the c.s.f. it varied from
1.6 to 4.2 min (mean 2.3) .                                             
  5. the rise of p in blood and c.s.f. was exponential . the rise in p  
in all experiments consisted of a fast component with time constants    
which varied between 0.2 and 0.9 min (mean 0.5) and a slow component    
with time constants varying between 6.7 and 14.7 (mean 11.6) .          
  the rise in p and p consisted of only one component . the time        
constants for the changes in jugular venous blood were 2.1, 3.8 and 4.3 
min, whilst in the c.s.f. they varied between 6.7 and 14.7 (mean 11.6) .
  6. it is probable that about 40 percent of the increase in ventilation
following co administration is due to stimulation of an area in the     
antero-lateral surface of the medulla sensitive to changes in ph or p   
(mitchell et al. 1963) . this area is superficial and ventilation is    
affected by changes in the p of the overlying c.s.f . it can be         
predicted from our experiments that the rise in p on co administration  
will take some 30 min to be complete . this may explain the slow rise in
ventilation on co breathing when compared with the rate of rise of      
arterial and jugular venous p .

studies on the compound lipids from x-ray irradiated animal, ii.        
biological and biochemical properties of the compound lipids in the     
x-ray irradiated rabbit organs .                                        
  for the purpose to clarify the causes of x-ray disturbances a series  
of experiments have been conducted on biological and biochemical        
properties of compound lipids extracted from normal and x-ray irradiated
rabbit organs with a special reference to the p -labeled compound lipids
uptake, inhibitory action to l cell proliferation and uncoupling of     
oxidative phosphorylation, and the following results have been obtained 
  the compound lipids (lysophosphatide rich fraction) isolated from the 
x-ray irradiated rabbit organ have been found to possess a strong       
hemolytic action and also an action to inhibit the cell proliferation as
well as to accelerate the respiration of the mitochondria in the rabbit 
liver and spleen . it has also been proven that they act as to induce a 
marked swelling of mitochondria, to impede the formation of high energy 
phosphate as well as to act as an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation
in vivo . in the test to see the uptake of p -labeled compound lipids by
various organs, a marked uptake has been observed in spleen, bone       
marrow, and liver of both irradiated and non-irradiated groups .        
further, the uptake of p -labeled compound lipids in the rabbits given  
intravenous injections of compound lipid fraction for 30 consecutive    
days previously has been found to be greatest in pancreas followed by   
bone marrow, spleen, liver in the order mentioned in male group, whereas
it is greatest in spleen, followed by liver and bone marrow in the      
female group .

cesium-131 uptake and distribution in the human heart.. an analysis of  
cardiac scans in 104 patients .                                         
  when properly used, cesium-131 is a satisfactory agent for the study  
of cardiac morphology by photoscanning, which we believe is a useful    
adjunctive diagnostic procedure in patients for whom the results of     
other methods of evaluation are at variance with the clinical symptoms  
of cardiac disease . the studies reported here suggest that perhaps     
infarction of a subclinical type, size, or location may occur earlier   
than has been previously thought and that the damage it leaves may not  
be detectable by any means other than autopsy or a technique such as    
scanning . we have not yet been able to measure the actual concentration
of cesium-131 in the heart at autopsy so that the cold and cool areas

oxygen consumption of paralysed men exposed to cold .                   
  1. oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide output were measured when    
human subjects were cooled for 80-210 min . two subjects were normal,   
one had been almost completely paralysed below the neck by              
poliomyelitis, and two were unconscious as a result of intracranial     
damage and were observed with and without paralysing doses of muscle    
relaxants (d-tubocurarine and gallamine) .                              
  2. when normal subjects and unconscious subjects receiving no drugs   
were cooled, oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide output rose .        
  3. when subjects paralysed by disease or drugs were cooled, oxygen    
consumption and carbon dioxide output were not increased .              
  4. these observations are consistent with the view that in man the    
increase in metabolism on cooling for periods up to 31/2 hr occurs      
solely in skeletal muscle .

heparin levels during and after hypothermic perfusion .

re-heparinization .                                                     
  2. heparin half-lives of approximately 13/4 hours and 21/2 hours were 
calculated during perfusions conducted at average temperatures of 31.5  
and 22.6 c. respectively .                                              
  3. the rate of heparin-loss during extracorporeal circulation is      
inconstant in an individual, and variable between individuals, so that  
exact neutralization requires an accurate estimation of the heparin     
concentration present at the end of perfusion .                         
  4. the protamine titration test provides a crude but simple and       
satisfactory means of monitoring free-heparin levels .                  
  5. complete neutralization of heparin is an important factor in       
minimizing postoperative blood losses .                                 
  6. protamine is a less efficient neutralizing agent than polybrene at 
the same dosage level . it may be most effective in divided dosage .

one instance was it of a degree likely to be significant .

platelet sequestration in man . i. methods .                            
  current methods of labeling platelets with chromium using             
ethylenediamine tetraacetate (edta) as an anticoagulant were found to   
cause rapid hepatic sequestration of nearly all the transfused platelets
about 50 returned to the circulation but then were partially destroyed
in the spleen . less than one-third survived . evidence is presented    
which indicates that edta is injurious to platelets .                   
  when an acid-citrate medium that buffered plasma at ph 6.5 was used as
an anticoagulant, 36 to 85 of the labeled platelets survived (average,  
62 ), and marked temporary sequestration did not occur . studies in     
thrombocytopenic persons showed that circulating platelet cr activity   
measures the true survival of such transfused platelets .               
  the survival and sequestration of platelets were studied in normal    
subjects . the survival data support the concept that platelets die     
chiefly by a process of senescence . external scintillation scanning of 
the various organs suggests that normally the majority of platelets is  
destroyed in the liver .

  a further case history has been presented . of the 15 patients with   
acute leukaemia in which the association has been recorded, there were  
other possible leukaemogenic factors in three, and in a further three   
the drug had been given for only a short time before the leukaemia was  
diagnosed . however, in the remaining nine, the histories are such that 
the phenylbutazone ingestion may have been associated with the          
development of the leukaemia . further studies, which should include    
matched controls, are indicated, and will be required before a definite 
opinion can be given as to any causal relationship between the drug and

excellent material for cardiac scanning, since a very low amount of

absorption of radiation can be reduced further by the administration of

hypothermia .                                                           
  the stress reaction caused by hypothermia was studied in rabbits      
subjected to controlled hypothermia by immersion in an icebath . some of
the animals were re-warmed . to anesthetize the animals, pentobarbitone 
sodium (nembutal) was given intraperitoneally, and, in some cases,      
followed by ether anesthesia . further, the stress reaction produced by 
pentobarbitone alone was studied in five animals, and that of ether     
anesthesia alone in three . no anesthesia was given to the three rabbits
placed in the refrigerator . the variation in distribution and amount of
adrenocortical lipids served as an indicator for evaluation of the      
stress reaction .                                                       
  in all the hypothermia tests there occurred changes in the            
distribution and amount of cortical lipids, denoting a stress reaction  
brought about by hypothermia . in rabbits, the barbiturate did not seem 
to inhibit the stress reaction . this may be attributed partly to the   
test animal, as such and partly to the fact that shivering of some      
extent always occurred during the hypothermia experiments .

use of a cross-circulation technique in studying respiratory responses  
to co .                                                                 
  the effect of hypercapnia and hypocapnia on ventilation was           
investigated in cross-circulated dogs in which the recipient dog's head 
and neck regions were perfused by blood from a donor dog . hypercapnia  
of the donor dog was produced by administering co -o -n gas mixtures in 
the inspired air . hypocapnia was produced by hyperventilating the donor
dog with the aid of a respiratory pump . when the donor dog was         
hyperventilated, the ventilation of the recipient was maintained at or  
just below its resting level and it was independent of the arterial pco 
of the donor . the donor dog was apneic when the artificial             
hyperventilation was suspended and this response was not abolished by   
vagotomy . bilateral vagotomy caused an increase in ventilation in the  
recipient when its head was perfused by hypocapnic blood . bilateral    
removal of the carotid receptors did not influence the response to co   
qualitatively although there was some reduction in the ventilation of   
the recipient to cephalic hypercapnia . the ventilation of the recipient
dog was best correlated to the ph and pco of its cerebrospinal fluid in 
both hypercapnic and hypocapnic states .

action of phytohaemagglutinin in vitro on the lymphocytes of chronic    
lymphoid leukaemia .                                                    
  the in vitro action of phytohaemagglutinin has been the subjects of a 
comparative investigation of the lymphocytes of 13 normal subjects and  
of 15 cases of chronic lymphatic leukaemia .                            
  in both groups there is cellular change shown by the appearance of    
large basophil nucleolated cells showing mitotic activity .             
  in all the cases of lymphatic leukaemia the percentage of cells       
undergoing such change is lower than in normal subjects, and the        
transformation occurs more slowly .                                     
  the two phenomena are more striking the higher the initial            
leucocytosis .                                                          
  these results suggest, in chronic lymphatic leukaemia, the cells      
affected by the transformation are residual normal lymphoid elements .  
leukaemic lymphoid cells appear to be incapable of this transformation .

demonstration of ventricular aneurysms by radioisotope scanning .       
  radioisotope scanning of the cardiac blood pool after the intravenous 
injection of i -labeled iodipamide was carried out in 14 patients with  
ventricular aneurysm . in 4, the aneurysm could be demonstrated on      
neither the anteroposterior chest roentgenogram nor the scan . in 5, the
aneurysm was apparent on the radiograph, but the blood pool did not     
enter the area, suggesting a thrombus within the aneurysm . in 5, the   
aneurysm was detectable on the film and was also seen to be filled with 
radioactivity on the scan . presumably these findings showed that a     
thrombus had not yet formed . blood pool radioisotope scanning appears  
to be another tool in the diagnosis of ventricular aneurysm, useful also
in demonstrating in some patients the presence or absence of an         
intraluminal clot within the aneurysm .

propagation of lactic dehydrogenase-elevating virus in cell culture .   
  primary cultures of adult mouse lung, spleen, and liver and of mouse  
embryo support the multiplication of the lactic dehydrogenase-elevating 
virus . such cultures produced virus continuously until they had been   
subcultured 2-3 times . this corresponded to 20 weeks in the case of    
lung and spleen and to 2-3 weeks with cultures of embryo . viral        
multiplication was not accompanied by cytologic alterations in the cells
or by changes in their rate of synthesis of nucleic acids or protein .  
infection did not cause detectable changes in either the production of  
ldh or in its release from cells .

  cells of bovine embryonic lung tissue in culture were inoculated with 
simian virus 40 (sv 40) or a phenol extract of a high titer suspension  
of sv 40 . both the virus and the nucleic acid preparation induced      
proliferative morphological changes characteristic for sv 40            
transformation . non-infected control cultures and cultures which were  
inoculated with a preparation of nucleic acid exposed to dnase and      
maintained under the same conditions as infected cultures showed a      
regular fibroblastic growth .                                           
  cell lines of rapidly growing transformed cells have been obtained .

rapid transformation of human fibroblast cultures by simian virus 40 .  
  the risk of systemic embolism is assessed in a group of 754 patients  
with chronic rheumatic heart disease followed over a period of 5,833    
patient-years .                                                         
  the incidence of embolism was 1.5 per patient-year for the whole group
it was seven times higher in atrial fibrillation than in sinus rhythm 
when the duration of atrial fibrillation was known, it was found that 
one-third of the emboli occurred within one month and two-thirds within 
12 months after the onset of atrial fibrillation . the incidence of     
embolic recurrences was 8 per patient-year, irrespective of the nature  
of the cardiac rhythm, but 66 of the recurrences took place within 12   
months of the initial embolic episode .                                 
  mitral valvotomy did not eliminate the danger of embolism . it is     
questionable whether it reduced its incidence .                         
  anticoagulant treatment reduced the incidence of embolic recurrences .

attitudinal factors in congenital heart disease .                       
  this study considers the behavioral implications of congenital heart  
disease for the pediatric patient, his siblings, and his parents . the  
effects of a disease on the child, on his siblings, and on his parents  
and the interplay among these individuals are explored . the impact of  
the physician's diagnosis is illustrated by the induced significant     
changes in family attitudes, which are not necessarily related to       
disease severity or child incapacity .                                  
  poorer adjustment and anxiety in the cardiac child related more highly
to maternal anxiety and pampering than to his degree of incapacity .    
maternal protectiveness and pampering were significantly greater in the 
cardiac than in the normal group and were highest in the cyanotic group 
the best predictor of maternal protectiveness was maternal anxiety,   
and it was found that the addition of other variables such as incapacity
and child dependence failed to improve prediction substantially .       
maternal anxiety seemed related to the presence rather than to the      
severity of the heart condition .

maternal anxiety during pregnancy and adequacy of mother and child      
adjustment eight months following childbirth .                          
  fifty pregnant women were administered a battery of psychological     
tests . on the basis of scores obtained from the manifest anxiety scale,
these pregnant women were dichotomized into a /high anxiety/ group and a
/low anxiety/ group . eight months following childbirth, the mothers and
children were seen for a psychological assessment . it was found that   
the women in the /high anxious/ group evidenced significantly more      
negative childrearing attitudes . that is, the /high anxious/ mothers   
obtained significantly higher scores on the hostility and control       
factors measured by the pari . on the basis of the examiner's ratings of
the mother's personality traits, it was found that the women who were   
highly anxious during pregnancy received much less favorable personality
ratings at the time of the 8-month assessment . moreover, there was a   
significant difference in the proportions of mothers in the two groups  
who received a favorable rating from the examiner on the basis of his   
observation of the mother-child interaction during the session . in     
studying the children of these mothers, it was found that the children  
of the /low anxious/ mothers received a significantly higher            
developmental quotient on the infant mental scale . in keeping with this
finding, they also obtained a higher developmental quotient on the motor
scale, although on this aspect of the intellectual assessment the       
difference was not statistically significant . also, the children from  
the /low anxious/ mothers tended to receive a score indicative of a more
favorable general emotional tone than did the offspring of the /high    
anxious/ mothers . this difference between the two groups of children   
was not statistically significant . in general, the findings were       
consistent with the predictions that the children who were being reared 
by women who had been highly anxious during pregnancy would fare less   
well on tests of intellectual development and indices of emotional      
adjustment . the findings also were in keeping with the prediction that 
the highly anxious women during pregnancy would evidence less desirable 
parental attitudes during their child's early development and that they 
would present a less favorable personality picture at a time            
approximately 8 months following pregnancy .

maternal separation in the rhesus monkey .                              
  the present study involved separation of eight monkey mother-infant   
pairs for a period of two weeks and measurement of the behavior of the  
infants before, during and after reunion with their mothers, and of the 
mothers before and after reunion . all infants showed emotional         
disturbance in response to separation and drastic decreases in play and 
other complex social behaviors while separated .                        
  it is clear that infant-mother separation produces emotional          
disturbance in both human and macaque infants and that the patterns of  
responses following separation are similar in both species . the results
obtained in studies of monkey infant-mother separation indicate that    
sheer physical separation is the crucial aspect of maternal separation  
for monkeys . undoubtedly other factors associated with separation from 
the mother are vitally important for human children, and may account in 
part for the absence or rarity of the detachment stage (as seen in human
response pattern) in separated monkey infants . the overall results show
considerable similarity in the responses of human children and infant   
monkeys to separation from the mother .

the ophthalmologist's role in the management of dyslexia .              
  dyslexia is a clinical entity characterized by subnormal reading      
ability in a person of average or above average intelligence .          
  it is a disease which has different causes in different children . the
causes include brain damage in the /language area,/ hereditary          
predisposition and such ophthalmic factors as hyperopia, muscle         
imbalance, aniseikonia or visual immaturity . emotional disturbances,   
educational immaturity and cerebral dominance may also play some role in
the etiology of this condition .                                        
  the universal symptom is poor reading ability . however, these cases  
frequently have other associated symptoms such as poor writing,         
difficulty in reading and writing numbers, inability to read or write   
musical notes and disorientation for left and right . many of these     
patients develop personality maladjustments . visual fields often reveal
a hemianopia .                                                          
  in any group of poor readers, a large percentage will have ocular,    
neurologic, psychiatric or psychologic abnormalities and/or a strong    
hereditary tendency . the degree to which reading can be learned depends
upon the ability of the individual to adjust to the psycho-physiologic  
needs that are present at the time he reaches /reading age/ in school . 
if compensating abilities are present, and if the child's reaction is a 
favorable one, he may read well in spite of unfavorable factors,. if    
not, he may become a /poor reader/ . these children should be recognized
in their first year of school .                                         
  a complete medical work-up should be managed by an ophthalmologist . a
complete ophthalmic examination should first be performed and all       
possible visual anomalies should be corrected . the ophthalmologist may 
want a psychometric evaluation, a neurologic opinion to determine the   
role of organic brain damage, psychiatric consultation for evaluation of
emotional disturbances, pediatric consultation for evaluation of the    
status of the general health and/or consultation by an otolaryngologist 
to determine the patient's hearing ability . with all the necessary     
information at hand, the ophthalmologist will be able to recommend      
corrective medical therapy and to advise the parents and teachers about 
available remedial reading aids .                                       
  the prognosis is good for most patients since they are of average or  
above average intelligence,. nearly all cases can be helped .

frontal lobes and vision .                                              
  the influence of the frontal lobe on vision is discussed based on the 
presentation of a rather unusual case . after the operation of a right  
frontal brain abscess, which never had led to papilledema, there was a  
pronounced diminution of the visual capacities of the patient,.         
gradually these disturbances regressed to the point of return of full   
visual acuity,. but there remained a hemianopic field defect . this and 
psychological defects in the sense of a partial visual agnosia (which   
latter are also regressing very well) prompted a discussion of those    
neuroanatomical and neurophysiological observations pertinent to the    
findings in this patient . the many data on the fronto-occipital        
connections in subhuman primates point to the role of the frontal lobe  
(area 8) in the development of visual disturbances in the sense of a    
temporary hemianopia with partial visual agnosia and some intellectual  
deficits . contrary to a single observation in an anthropoid ape, our   
case would seem to indicate that the aforementioned combination of      
symptoms may originate in the frontal lobe,. and we hope it will prompt 
other long-term follow-up studies of similar patients . the continued   
observation of this patient and perhaps of others will give a           
possibility to gain insight into the role of the frontal lobe in vision,
as has been assumed for animals .

evoked response in visual disorders .                                   
  1. erg and ver have been recorded from eyelid and lateral occipital   
electrodes in response to diffuse stroboscopic stimulation . in 45      
normal subjects ver was found to be composed of an early triphasic      
potential arising from the occipital region . wave i was present in 67  
percent of subjects, wave ii in 97 percent, and wave iii in 100 percent 
later waves were inconstant and contained components from the vertex  
reference . no overall asymmetry in ver from right to left was found in 
normal subjects, although average asymmetry with smaller side compared  
to larger was 19 percent 12.5 . on monocular stimulation the            
contralateral ver was regularly larger than the ipsilateral reflecting  
predominant retinal representation of the temporal field .              
  2. a statistically determined criterion of 50 percent depression in   
wave ii successfully identifies most patients with hemianopic defects   
involving the central 10 percent of visual field on tangent screen      
campimetry .                                                            
  latency asymmetry of six msec. or more and grossly asymmetrical       
aberrant wave forms are seen in some patients with diffuse cerebral     
disease and hemianopic defects .                                        
  3. severe or diffuse retinal disease is associated with alteration or 
loss of erg and ver on stimulation of the involved eye .                
  4. optic nerve disease is indicated by bilateral loss or suppression  
of ver on stimulation of the involved eye . erg is normal .             
  5. bilateral prechiasmal involvement is associated with complete      
suppression of ver . if only waves i and ii are lost, disease is        
probably, but not conclusively, demonstrated .                          
  6. involvement of nasal retinal fibres is indicated by reversal of the
normal contralateral preponderance of ver on monocular stimulation .    
these changes are observed in chiasmal disease .                        
  7. retrogeniculate blindness is associated with loss of early ver and 
preservation of late response . nonspecific projections are felt to     
contribute to the late cortical response to photic stimulation .

optokinetic nystagmus and occipital lesions .                           
  six cases are presented to invalidate the rule that horizontally      
symmetric optokinetic responses indicate a vascular etiology in patients
with occipital lobe type hemianopias . the converse of this rule is, in 
our experience, still a valuable observation . that is, asymmetry of    
horizontal optokinetic responses accompanying an occipital type field   
defect is a strong indication of a mass lesion . optokinetic nystagmus  
may be helpful, therefore, as corroborative evidence in diagnosing      
occipital lobe tumor but not in ruling it out .

disturbances of the verbal body image.. a particular syndrome of sensory
aphasia .                                                               
  1. the pto syndrome of the dominant hemisphere varies according to the
extent and depth of the lesion in the angular and supramarginal areas . 
the mildest clinical syndrome consists of a vague contralateral sensory 
impairment associated with dyscalculia, dysgraphia, dyslexia and        
difficulty in naming . a more extensive lesion is needed to cause the   
wide variety of classical signs described in parietal lobe disease,     
among them being gerstmann's syndrome, which is usually found in        
association with other manifestations of parietal loss (case 1) . an    
even more extensive corticosubcortical lesion in the area leads to      
complete disintegration of naming and understanding of speech (cases 3, 
4 and 5) .                                                              
  2. attention is drawn to the difficulties arising from lack of        
differentiation between the concrete gnostic body image and the abstract
verbal body image in investigation of these patients . the aphasic      
syndrome should be differentiated from disturbances of gnosis by        
application of separate, non-verbal methods of testing to elicit the    
impairment of the gnostic body image . the latter may be well           
compensated for and it is apparently unimpaired in the presence of an   
aphasic syndrome limited to the verbal body image .                     
  3. disturbances of speech in pto lesions if investigated along        
quantitative scales of impairment of repetition, understanding and      
naming, show a regular interrelation . nomination is the most affected, 
understanding is less affected . repetition is the best preserved       
function (cases 1-4) . the same interrelation of these functions is     
found with regard to the verbal body image . however, understanding and 
naming of parts of the body show far greater disintegration than        
understanding and naming of any other categories of words (all cases    
presented here) . if the aphasic syndrome is subsiding, finger aphasia  
with some other minor disturbances of verbal body image associated with 
acalculia may persist (case 1) . thus gerstmann's /finger agnosia/ may  
represent a partial impairment of the verbal body image and be limited  
to finger aphasia .                                                     
  4. it is assumed that the verbal body image differs from other        
categories of verbal symbols owing to the mainly proprioceptive,        
vestibular and tactile experience forming its specific physiologic      
background . telereceptive experience is of minor importance in the     
initial development of the understanding of words defining the body     
image .                                                                 
  in the patients described here, the selectively worse aphasic         
impairment of the verbal body image, as compared with other categories  
of words, seem to confirm this assumption .

chromosomal patterns in cancer patients during treatment .              
  radiation damages the chromosomes of human cells, and through         
short-term cultures of white blood cells some of this damage can be     
assessed . patients with cancer were selected for this study because of 
the large portions of the blood-forming tissues irradiated in the course
of treatment . chromosomal damage may be quantitative with variations   
from the normal number of 46, or qualitative, thereby showing structural
aberrations . counting the chromosomes in cells from cultures grown     
prior to therapy and at intervals during treatment enables us to        
determine the variation .                                               
  stained preparations examined microscopically allow us to recognize   
these abnormalities which are apparent before, during, and after        
radiotherapy . the damage appears to be largely random in the           
chromosomes affected in the different cancers, and the specific         
aberrations differ from cell to cell . however, there does seem to be   
some correlation between the appearance of persistent aberrant          
chromosomes and their frequency . while the peak incidence or /plateau/ 
may remain unchanged, the frequency may change .

a few interesting neurologic manifestations of migraine .               
  migraine is a complex vascular phenomenon presumably of genetic origin
which, through changes induced by either vasoconstriction or            
vasodilitation, can produce interference with the neurologic system and 
result in many bizarre and alarming clinical pictures . a few examples  
of the more interesting neurologic manifestations have been shown .

visual neglect .                                                        
  clinical trainees in nursing and in psychology from boston college and
simmons college, boston, mass., collected data and observed patients    
under the direction of the authors in a pilot program designed to       
measure visual spatial neglect and to develop rehabilitative material . 
these measurements and exercises might also be used by nurses in their  
care of those patients who have had cerebral vascular accidents .       
  the diversity of daily activities in which the patient becomes        
involved during his hospitalization should provide some indication of   
the extent to which the compensatory visual neglect therapeutics have   
been effective . more formal estimates can be obtained by               
re-administering the battery of visual neglect tests at periodic        
intervals . nursing personnel adopting a program of therapeutics such as
this must bear in mind that patients suffering cerebral insult are      
usually less adaptive than their nonbrain-injured peers . they develop  
new habit patterns slowly and regression often will follow apparent     
fixation at a more adaptive level of response habituation(11) . however,
experimental inquiry has shown that the dimension of behavioral         
difference between the brain-injured adults and normal adults is one of 
degree rather than kind -dash a difference that skilled nursing can     
often reduce(12) .

respiratory changes after open-heart surgery .                          
  patients who undergo cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation  
develop significant alveolar-arterial oxygen tension differences and    
venous admixture in the early post-operative period . up to 50 of this  
abnormality is due to anatomical right to left shunting through the     
lungs.. the remainder is most likely to be due to ventilation-perfusion 
inequality . the changes appear to be completely reversible . the       
cardiopulmonary bypass procedure may be responsible for initiating the  
underlying pathology, since changes of this magnitude were not found in 
cardiothoracic surgery patients in whom this technique was not required

cardiac malformations associated with ventricular septal defect .       
  in this study, 46 necropsy-proved cases of ventricular septal defect  
associated with another anomaly but not part of a recognized complex    
were selected .                                                         
  the associated anomalies were classified as (1) obstructive or        
positional anomalies of the great vessels, (2) anomalies responsible for
additional shunts, (3) anomalies causing intraventricular obstruction   
and (4) aortic valvular insufficiency .                                 
  clinical findings were often those of the ventricular septal defect,  
and the findings related to the associated lesion were frequently       
obscure . even with special studies, including cardiac catheterization  
and angiocardiography, there was often failure to arrive at a complete  
diagnosis . the findings which led to an erroneous or incomplete        
diagnosis have been presented . when a complete diagnosis was made      
preoperatively, the procedures leading to it have been outlined . while 
the diagnostic approach varies with the malformations which may coexist 
with ventricular septal defect, it was observed that aortography and    
selective left ventricular angiocardiography were most commonly helpful 
in identifying occult malformations associated with ventricular septal  
defect . it is therefore recommended that complete studies, including   
left-sided cardiac catheterization with left ventricular                
angiocardiography and aortography, should be considered in all cases in 
which the clinical, electrocardiographic, and right-sided cardiac       
catheterization studies are not entirely typical for isolated           
ventricular septal defect .

anatomic types of single or common ventricle in man morphologic and     
geometric aspects of 60 necropsied cases .                              
  in 60 necropsied cases of single or common ventricle in man, four     
major unrelated ventricular malformations were found.. (1) absence of   
the right ventricular sinus, in 47 cases (78 percent), designated type  
a,. (2) absence of the left ventricular sinus, in 3 cases (5 percent),  
type b,. (3) absence or rudimentary development of the ventricular      
septum, in 4 cases (7 percent), type c,. and (4) absence of both        
ventricular sinuses and of the ventricular septum, in 6 cases (10       
percent), type d .                                                      
  three types of relationship between the great arteries were present.. 
a normal (solitus) interrelationship, in 9 cases (15 percent),          
designated type 1,. d-transposition, the transposed aortic valve lying  
to the right (dextro, or d), relative to the transposed pulmonary valve,
in 25 cases (42 percent), type ii,. and l-transposition, the transposed 
aortic valve lying to the left (levo or l), relative to the transposed  
pulmonary valve, in 26 cases (43 percent), type iii . in none was the   
inversus interrelationship, type iv, displayed .                        
  three types of visceral and atrial situs were found.. solitus, or     
normal, in 50 cases (83 percent),. inversus, an exact apparent mirror   
image of normal, in 2 cases (3 percent),. and heterotaxy, the uncertain 
visceral and atrial situs associated with asplenia, in 8 cases (13      
percent) .                                                              
  the 60 cases were classified segmentally, according to the anatomy of 
the three cardiac segments.. the great arteries, the ventricular        
sinuses, and the atria .                                                
  the classic single ventricle with a rudimentary outlet chamber was    
found morphologically to be a large left ventricle with a right         
ventricular infundibulum, the sinus of the right ventricle being absent 
(type a) .                                                              
  the myocardium of the right ventricular infundibulum, of the right    
ventricular sinus, and of the left ventricular sinus was identified by  
the distinctive gross morphologic characteristics of each .             
  the planes of the atrial and ventricular septa, and the relationships 
between the great arteries at the semilunar valves, were measured as    
projections upon the horizontal plane, relative to the anteroposterior  
line .                                                                  
  an approach to cardiac anatomy is presented which is segmental,       
morphologic and geometric . this approach has angiocardiographic,       
electrocardiographic and embryologic applications .

congenital heart disease in the adult .                                 
  events in the natural course of 310 adult patients with proved        
significant congenital cardiac anomalies have been reviewed to determine
incidence, longevity, complications and cause of death .                
  atrial septal defect and patent ductus arteriosus were the most       
frequently encountered lesions and comprised over one third of the      
entire series . ventricular septal defect and pulmonic stenosis made up 
almost a quarter of the group . twenty-two instances of the eisenmenger 
syndrome secondary to a variety of shunting lesions are included .      
  bacterial endocarditis, sudden death and cardiac decompensation were  
the greatest threats to these patients . symptoms were minimal until the
appearance of heart failure, which was the most common cause of death,  
especially with older patients . sudden death occurred most often in    
patients with ventricular septal defect .                               
  although the clinical features are usually characteristic of a        
congenital malformation, young adults with acyanotic congenital heart   
disease are often misdiagnosed as rheumatic,. and in older patients,    
presenting manifestations are frequently attributed to arteriosclerotic 
heart disease . at times an associated acquired cardiovascular disorder 
may alter the basic syndrome .                                          
  three quarters of the patients survive and continue under observation 
the ability of many to live active, productive lives and to withstand 
stress, surgery, both cardiac and non-cardiac, and pregnancy was        
impressive . further observation of the patient with congenital heart   
disease but without surgical intervention is essential for accurate     
evaluation of the long term efficacy of cardiac surgery .

  clinical, electrocardiographic, radiographic, and hemodynamic findings
in 12 children with the combination of a ventricular septal defect and  
aortic insufficiency are presented . the left-to-right shunt was        
determined to be small or moderate in all, and significant aortic       
insufficiency was documented by aortography in 11 patients . clinical   
indication of aortic insufficiency as manifested by an aortic diastolic 
murmur first appeared at an average age of 6 years in 7 patients, with  
concomitant widening of the pulse pressure in 4 . progressive left      
ventricular hypertrophy was noted electrocardiographically, with        
progressive cardiac hypertrophy and aortic dilatation on x-ray          
examination in 2 patients . progression of the hemodynamic disability   
does not appear to be common in childhood, however .

ventricular septal defect and aortic regurgitation clinical, hemodynamic
and surgical considerations .                                           
  the clinical, hemodynamic, angiographic and anatomic findings in      
fifteen patients with ventricular septal defect complicated by aortic   
regurgitation are presented . in this combination of malformations the  
aortic regurgitation is acquired and results from prolapse of an aortic 
valve leaflet into the septal defect . the strategic location of the    
septal defect in relation to the aortic leaflets appears to be more     
important to the development of this complication than the size of the  
defect or the magnitude of the shunt through it . the onset of aortic   
regurgitation occurs during early childhood and, once present, tends to 
become more severe . careful observation of patients with these defects 
is indicated following the appearance of aortic regurgitation since     
rapid progression to severe left ventricular failure is not uncommon .  
ventricular septal defect and aortic regurgitation must be distinguished
from other cardiovascular abnormalities producing a wide pulse pressure 
with a continuous or to-and-fro murmur . cardiac catheterization and    
thoracic aortography are the diagnostic procedures most helpful in this 
differentiation . the operative treatment of ventricular septal defect  
and aortic regurgitation is reviewed and, on the basis of the present   
and previously reported results, suggested plans for surgical management
are presented .

current techniques in the surgical approach to aortic and mitral

  1. the aortic and mitral valves can be operated upon successfully and 
totally replaced with a prosthetic device of the ball-valve type with   
good long-term results . seventy-four cases are reported .              
  2. in aortic valvular disease the outcome in the immediate            
postoperative period is influenced primarily by the presence of calcific
aortic stenosis as well as the presence or absence of disease in the    
coronary arteries .                                                     
  3. we have significantly decreased the appearance of a low-output     
syndrome postoperatively in patients who are suffering from severe      
mitral disease by leaving the papillary muscle-chordae tendineae-mural  
leaflet relationship intact . we feel this adds strength to each        
contraction .

effects of aortic regurgitation on left ventricular performance direct  
determinations of aortic blood flow before and after valve replacement .
  the volume of regurgitant blood flow and its effects on the           
performance of the left ventricle were assessed at operation in 14      
patients with varying degrees of aortic regurgitation . instantaneous   
forward and regurgitant flows in the ascending aorta were measured with 
a sine-wave electromagnetic flowmeter simultaneously with left          
ventricular and aortic pressures . in eight patients who had aortic     
regurgitation without associated stenosis, 63 to 75 percent of the total
forward stroke volume regurgitated during the succeeding diastole . the 
calculated regurgitant orifice areas ranged from 0.13 to 0.44 cm /m .   
after replacement of the aortic valve with a starr-edwards prosthesis,  
the absence of regurgitant flow was proved in every patient, and the    
records of aortic blood flow closely resembled those seen in patients   
with normal aortic valves . net forward blood flow increased by an      
average of 60 percent, total left ventricular stroke volume fell 42     
percent, and the mean aortic pressure rose 29 percent . the pressure    
work of the left ventricle was elevated preoperatively in five of the   
eight patients (average 89 g-m stroke/m ) and fell significantly to an  
average of 34 g-m stroke m after valve replacement . kinetic ventricular
work was high in seven of the eight patients and comprised 10 percent of
total work before replacement but only 4.8 percent afterward .          
  similar observations were made in five patients with aortic stenosis  
and associated aortic regurgitation, ranging in severity from 24 to 72  
percent of total forward stroke volume . in four patients in whom the   
valve was replaced, no residual regurgitation was present afterward, and
net forward flow rose an average of 49 percent . kinetic left           
ventricular work was extremely high in every patient and averaged 26    
percent of total work preoperatively and 13 percent after valve         
replacement . in this group, pressure work was variable both before and 
after operation .                                                       
  the studies described provide definitive information concerning the   
effects of aortic valve disease on left ventricular performance in man  
and document the favorable changes in flow, pressure, and left          
ventricular work which immediately follow aortic valve replacement .

the absorption and hepatic uptake of orally ingested radioactive vitamin
b in hepato-splenic bilharziasis .                                      
  the absorbed plasma radioactivity and hepatic uptake of orally        
ingested vitamin b tagged with co were measured in 52 subjects, 26      
normals and 26 suffering from bilharziasis .

bilharziasis irrespective of the stage of the disease, the size of the  
organs affected and the presence or absence of associated peripheral    
neuritis .

early effects of digitalis on central hemodynamics in normal subjects .

  1. an early significant reduction of heart rate .                     
  2. a significant transient reduction of cardiac output .              
  3. a significant increase of the stroke volume initially accompanied  
by a significant rise of the end-diastolic volume with unchanged        
systolic rate of emptying . the increase of end-diastolic volume seems  
to be related to the lengthening of the diastolic filling period . later
on, the systolic emptying rate increases, and the ventricular volumes   
decrease, suggesting an inotropic effect of the drug .                  
  4. a significant increase of pulmonary blood volume, parallel to the  
increase of the stroke volume, suggestive of a passive relation between 
the two variables .

  in 23 patients undergoing open-heart surgery in whom the pericardial  
contents were accurately measured, and in 11 additional patients        
examined at autopsy or by pericardiocentesis, isotopic photoscans of the
heart were made and the results were correlated .                       
  the most accurate means of diagnosis of pericardial effusion was found
to be the ratio of the maximum transverse cardiac diameters on scan and 
roentgenogram . in patients with less than 100 cc of pericardial fluid  
this ratio was greater than 0.80, and it was less than this in cases of 
effusion of 200 cc or more .                                            
  measurement of the difference of these diameters, and visible         
separation of the cardiac blood pool from the pulmonary vasculature and 
liver aided in the diagnosis .                                          
  pericardial effusions of 200-300 cc or greater can be detected by     
isotopic photoscanning . although cardiac dilatation and/or hypertrophy 
decrease the sensitivity of the technique somewhat, a definite diagnosis
of pericardial effusion can be made even when cardiomegaly exists .

aneurysm of the membranous septum .                                     
  1. aneurysms of the membranous septum are relatively rare lesions     
presumably developing on a congenital basis . these aneurysms originate 
in the left ventricle immediately beneath the aortic valve and bulge    
into the right ventricle, the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve or  
into the right atrium .                                                 
  2. many of these aneurysms do not produce symptoms . others may cause 
right ventricular outflow tract obstruction or may rupture and result in
a septal defect . the resulting shunt will be from the left ventricle   
into the right atrium or ventricle .                                    
  3. an aneurysm of the membranous septum may be an isolated abnormality
or be associated with other congenital cardiac defects, particularly    
aortic valvular insufficiency . membranous septal aneurysms may be the  
site of bacterial endocarditis or thrombus formation .                  
  4. aneurysms resembling those arising from the membranous septum may  
occur as part of the complex of deformities produced by an endocardial  
cushion defect . however, the angiographic features diagnostic of a     
cushion defect can still be recognized .

distribution of transfused tritiated cytidine-labeled leukocytes and red
cells in the bone marrow of normal and irradiated rat .                 
  in normal rats and after total body irradiation with 550 r of x-rays, 
the fate in the bone marrow of labeled nucleated and red cells of       
transfused peripheral blood was observed autoradiographically .         
  labeled nucleated cells, most of which were lymphocyte-like cells,    
readily migrated into the marrow parenchyma in normal animals (2 cells/ 
1,000 parenchymal cells/hr.) . following irradiation to at least 27-51  
hr., this migration appeared to be relatively increased . beyond this   
time, parenchymal areas were more difficult to be defined as such .     
  labeled red cells were rarely observed to enter parenchyma despite the
presence of nonlabeled erythrocytes within the parenchymal structure    
after irradiation .                                                     
  the vascular bed following irradiation increased greatly as the       
parenchyma diminished to a minimum of less than 10 percent control at 75
hr . despite these changes in the architecture of the marrow, the       
average density of labeled cells per area of marrow corresponded to     
values expected on the assumption of a free-flowing circulation . the   
technique used at present did not allow us to distinguish, at all times,
between a free-flowing circulation through intact sinusoids or through  
areas in which the sinusoidal wall, as such, was destroyed .

factors limiting survival after circulatory occlusion under hypothermia

  thirty minutes of circulatory occlusion with mild hypothermia and     
hyperbaric oxygen ventilation resulted in a mortality of 83.3 percent in
animals . when coronary perfusion from a reservoir was added, the       
mortality rate was 22 percent . ventricular fibrillation was much more  
easily reversed after coronary perfusion . there was no evidence of     
brain damage in survivors which leads to the conclusion that the brain  
tolerates circulatory arrest better than the heart under these          
conditions .

  total circulatory occlusion and release result in hemodynamic         
phenomena which provide an index of integrity of some cardiovascular    
reflexes . these include carotid sinus and aortic baroceptors,          
arteriolar vasomotor tone, and venomotor reactivity .                   
  baroceptor depression appears at a more moderate level of cooling than
does the sympathetic, vasomotor, depression . below 28 degrees c. both  
are significantly depressed, although probably not totally abolished .  
  the level of 28 degrees c. is a critical physiological level and may  
represent an important limit in the clinical use of hypothermia .

studies in perfusion hypothermia with special reference to /deep        
hypothermia/ and circulatory arrest .                                   
  1. perfusion hypothermia produces large temperature gradients within  
the body since organs are cooled roughly in proportion to their basal   
blood flows . the difference between the coldest and the warmest portion
of the body after 30 minutes of perfusion exceeds 25 c .                
  2. the average body temperature, which provides a proper measure of   
total body cooling, may be calculated from the arteriovenous temperature
difference and the extracorporeal flow rate .                           
  3. true /deep/ hypothermia is not obtainable by reasonable periods of 
perfusion alone .                                                       
  4. an important rise of core temperatures occurs during circulatory   
arrest in hypothermia because of relatively high average body           
temperature .                                                           
  5. high average body temperatures lead to continuing production of    
lactic acid in muscle tissue, whereas low core temperatures impair      
lactic acid metabolism . thus metabolic acidosis is progressive in      
prolonged perfusion hypothermia, and is accentuated by total circulatory
arrest . progressive acidosis may be minimized by uniform profound      
cooling by combining external with perfusion hypothermia .              
  6 diluents appear to have little effect on total body heat exchange   
during perfusion cooling .                                              
  7. perfusion warming has a differentially greater effect on core      
organs . though these are readily brought to a normal range, much of the
animal may remain cold .

nickel carbonyl.. its detection and potential for formation .           
  recent recommendations for control of nickel carbonyl exposures have  
been considered in the design of a simple, sensitive field method for   
sampling nickel carbonyl in air and process gases . the method involves 
collection in dilute aqueous hcl, ph adjustment, nickel complex         
development with alpha-furildioxime, and extraction with chloroform .   
color intensity is compared visually (or for greater accuracy,          
spectrophotometrically) with liquid standards . sensitivities on the    
order of 0.001 ppm are obtainable . a detailed development of the       
thermodynamics associated with the formation of nickel carbonyl is also 
presented to show the maximum concentrations of nickel carbonyl that may
be formed over a wide range of co concentrations, temperatures and      
pressures .

emission spectrography .                                                
  x-ray emission spectrography has been applied to study of the         
elemental composition of human teeth, enamel, dentine and bone . the    
material consisted of eight crushed teeth, enamel and dentine powder    
separated from eighteen teeth, and four pieces of buccal cortical       
mandibular bone . the teeth did not have fillings . the whole material  
contained nineteen elements, of which the main ones were calcium and    
phosphorus . in all the samples of tooth material, there were found ca, 
p, cl, fe, zn, sr and k, and the bone also contained ni . the time      
needed for a semi-quantitative analysis compares very favourably with   
that needed for other methods .

a kinetic study of nickel(ii), complexes of sulfur-containing amino acid
  the rate expression for the ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta)    
ligand exchange reaction with nickel(cysteine) is.. rate = k(complex) + 
kedta (complex)(edta) . this two-term rate expression is characteristic 
of square planar complexes and agrees with the square planar            
configuration of ni(cysteine) reported on the basis of spectral studies 
the edta-independent term of the rate expression is an acid-catalyzed 
term and can be written k (h) (complex) . the value of kn is 2.5 x 10 m 
sec while the value of kedta is only on the order of 10 -10 m sec . the 
edta reaction with ni(cysteine) methyl ester) is very similar to the    
reaction with ni(cysteine) . when the sulfur-containing amino acid      
ligand contains a thiol ether, the kinetic differences are striking .   
  ligand exchange reactions of edta, triethylenetetramine, and          
diethylenetriamine with nickel-methionine complexes are several orders  
of magnitude faster and give products that are mixed-ligand complexes . 
the results of this kinetic study of amino acid complexes containing    
sulfhydryl and thiol ether sulfur groups support other studies at       
equilibrium which suggest sulfur coordination and square planar         
complexes for the sulfhydryl groups and octahedral complexes with no    
sulfur coordination for thiol ethers .

the action of metal ions on tobacco mosaic virus ribonucleic acid .     
  added transition metal ions stabilize the secondary structure of      
tobacco mosaic virus ribonucleic acid (tmv-rna) as evidenced by a       
reduction in the absorbancy change of heated nucleic acid solutions . in
spite of this stabilization of secondary structure, heating in the      
presence of metal ions results in the loss of biological activity due to
the hydrolysis of phosphodiester bonds . thus, all heavy metal ions of  
the iib and first-transition elements studied caused a rapid loss of    
biological activity of tmv-rna at ph 6.5 and 65 . calcium and magnesium 
ions, while not affecting secondary structure at 65 and ph 8.5, caused a
rapid loss of biological activity . at ph 5.8 and room temperature lead 
ions catalyzed the hydrolysis of rna to i'(3')- mononucleotides,. on    
long standing, nucleosides were formed .

mortality, tumors and tissue levels .                                   
  about 700 mice were given throughout their lives 5 ppm cadmium, lead, 
chromium, nickel or titanium in drinking water while fed a diet         
deficient in cadmium and low in other metals . tissue concentrations    
comparable to those of man were observed . sex differences appeared .   
mortality of females was unaffected . mortality of males on cadmium,    
lead and nickel was increased compared with that of the chromium group, 
and of those on cadmium and lead compared with the controls . longevity 
of the oldest 10 of both sexes was less in lead and titanium groups, and
of males in cadmium group, compared with controls . no metal was        
carcinogenic,. incidence of tumors in males on cadmium and lead, and in 
females given nickel was decreased . body weights at death were greater 
in titanium, chromium and lead groups . large increments of titanium,   
moderate increments of cadmium and nickel, and lesser increments of     
chromium and lead were observed in 5 organs, compared with controls .   
higher concentrations of cadmium and titanium occurred in younger mice  
and the other metals did not increase markedly in tissues with age . all
metals except chromium exhibited one or more signs of innate toxicity .

synergistic effects between antioxidants and selenium or vitamin e .

the compounds were toxic, as evidenced by sudden death or subcutaneous  
hemorrhages . when amounts of either selenite or a-tocopheryl acetate,  
which individually had little or no effect on symptoms, were given with 
the antioxidants signs of deficiency and mortality were prevented, and

responses of b. subtilis (atcc 558) to streptomycin .                   
  to observe in detail the influence of streptomycin on the growth of sm
dependent type, the author chose b. subtilis (atcc 558) and made        
experiments on its responses to streptomycin, with special reference to 
the relation of the sm concentration with spore formation of its sm     
dependent type together with germination and outgrowth of the spores    
formed . the results are as follows .                                   
  1. among 18x10 cells of wild type of b. subtilis (atcc 558) about     
3,200 cells of sm resistant and one cell of sm dependent are found as   
its mutant .                                                            
  2. b. substilis (atcc 558) shows normal growth at sm concentration    
below 10 r/ml, but the growth declines rapidly between sm 10 r/ml-20 r/m
l, and the growth stops entirely at sm concentration 20 r/ml .          
  3. sm resistant type grows well between sm 0.1 r/ml-sm 2,000 r/ml, the
growth declines rapidly at about sm 10,000 r/ml .                       
  4. sm dependent type shows normal growth between sm 10,000 r/ml-20 r/m
l, the growth get worth below sm 10 r/ml, and the cell shape elongates  
several times, at sm below 1 r/ml each cell becomes filamentous form and
has several ten times length of normal cell, as if the cells have       
stopped to divide at low sm concentration .                             
  6. the germination and outgrowth of spores of the sm dependent type   
slow down with decline of sm concentration, but the germinated spores   
grow in normal forms until sm concentration reaches 7.8 r/ml, then the  
germination becomes much slower, and the cells grow in filamentous forms
or irregular forms . at extremely low sm concentration both germination 
and outgrowth nearly stop .

  in the present study, lenses were removed from the eyes of adult      
anesthetized newts, macerated in 0.03 m borate buffer at ph 8.6, and    
separated by starch gel electrophoresis . upon staining with amido black
10-b, seven distinct staining areas appeared in the blocks . three bands
moved toward the anode, and three toward the cathode . in addition, a   
seventh moiety represented by a smear of material moved toward the anode
one millimeter times five tenths millimeter plugs were removed from   
each of these areas and were placed into freshly lentectomized eyes .   
plugs from most strongly positive and most weakly negative proteins     
inhibited lens regeneration . in addition, plugs from the area          
containing the weakly negative protein induced either lenses with       
aberrant polarity or double centered lenses with centers of opposed     
polarity . all other protein bands had no significant effect on

proteinasedigested homogenates of lenses were injected into eyes        
following lentectomy . three 5-ul samples were injected in each case

  a partially single-stranded dna, prepared by limited digestion of each
strand with exonuclease iii, can be restored to its native, fully       
double-stranded structure by escherichia coli dna polymerase . the rate 
of synthesis observed in the repair of such a partially degraded primer

the newly synthesized dna is covalently attached to the primer . the    
fully repaired dna resembles the original native dna as judged by its   
appearance in electron micrographs, cscl density-gradient analysis,     
denaturability and genetic activity . dna synthesis which follows the   
repair phase produces a structure that is not covalently linked to the  
primer and resembles, in its nondenaturability, branched appearance, and
lack of genetic activity, the product obtained with a native dna primer

  the molecular fate of transforming dna in competent bacillus subtilis 
has been studied . the physical differentiation of transforming dna and 
the genetic material of recipient bacteria was effected by employing the
isotopes n and p . competent bacteria labeled with n and p were allowed 
to incorporate n p-labeled transforming dna intracellularly . dna was   
isolated from these recipient cells and centrifuged in cesium chloride .
analysis of drop fractions collected at equilibrium showed the presence 
of radioactivity in a region of density corresponding to recipient dna .
material contribution from donor dna to the resident dna did not occur  
when genetically inert bacillus cereus dna was substituted for          
homologous dna . it was concluded that radioactivity appearing in the   
unlabeled resident dna was not the result of degradation of input (     
p)dna and subsequent incorporation by normal metabolic processes . since
single-stranded dna of donor origin was not detected, nor was there     
evidence for the non-specific aggregation of donor and recipient dna, it
was concluded that the observed physical association of transforming and
recipient dna occurs as a result of genetic recombination in transformed
b. subtilis .

bacillus subtilis transforming dna treated by low ph, nitrous acid, or  
hydroxylamine at different temperatures . the frequency of mutants      
increased linearly with time for all three agents, whereas the logarithm
of survival gave a linear plot only for nitrous acid and low ph . an    
arrhenius plot showed the same slopes for both inactivation and mutation
rates after treatment with low ph or nitrous acid,. for the latter agent
the slope remained unaltered even when the dna was treated in the

hormone therapy in metastatic breast cancer.. clinical response and     
urinary gonadotrophins .                                                
  the total urinary gonadotrophin output of a group of post menopausal  
women with metastatic breast carcinoma undergoing hormone therapy, which
in every case initially consisted of treatment with diethylstilboestrol,
des (ca. 20 mg/d), has been studied for periods varying from seven      
months to 31/2 years .                                                  
  no correlation between gonadotrophin output and clinical response was 
found, except that in all cases showing objective regression urinary    
gonadotrophin remained low throughout the remission period . a low level
of gonadotrophin output was not, however, necessarily indicative of a   
good clinical remission . following withdrawal of des, and independent  
of the period of therapy, recovery to pre-treatment levels was the rule 
rather than the exception .                                             
  a small group of patients maintained on a lower dose of des (3-5 mg/d)
showed the same degree of suppression of urinary output as those        
receiving 20 mg/d, and several of these exhibited objective remissions .
  the study has emphasised the importance of site specificity in the    
response to hormone therapy, and underlines the difficulties of relating
the clinical response of the patient as a whole to changes in hormonal  
environment .

plasma androgens in women i. normal and non-hirsute females,

  1. in a group of 20 normal non-hirsute females age 17 to 38, 18 non-  
hirsute patients with varied genito-urinary disorders, 8 oophorectomized
and or adrenalectomized patients plasma testosterone was measured by the
method of finkelstein et al. (1961) . conjugated androsterone and       
conjugated dhea were determined by a modified method of migeon + plager 
(1955) .

testosterone, 11.8 5.5 ug/100 ml conjugated androsterone, and 29.5 15.5 
ug/100 ml conjugated dhea . no significant response to hcg could be seen
dexamethasone affected the conjugated dhea significantly, but did not 
seem to affect conjugated androsterone or testosterone .                
  3. the non-hirsute patients showed essentially the same pattern . an  
effect of dexamethasone on the levels of conjugated androsterone was    
demonstrated .

oophorectomy and cortisone treatment as a method of eliminating         
oestrogen production in patients with breast cancer .                   
  the urinary excretion of oestrone, oestradiol-17b, oestriol, and 17-  
hydroxycorticosteroids has been estimated in 55 premenopausal and 91    
postmenopausal women with breast cancer at various stages of the disease
before therapy . the depletion of oestrogen excretion caused by         
oophorectomy combined with cortisone treatment was studied in the       
patients with metastasising breast tumours (32 premenopausal and 56     
postmenopausal subjects) .                                              
  patients with disseminating breast cancer excreted significantly      
larger quantities of oestriol than healthy women of the same age,       
whether pre- or postmenopausal . the excretion of oestrone and          
oestradiol-17b was similar in cancer patients and healthy women of      
corresponding age .                                                     
  oophorectomy reduced the oestrogen excretion not only in premenopausal
subjects but also in quite a number of postmenopausal patients,         
particularly in those who were still excreting significant amounts of   
oestrogens . this decrease in the oestrogen output was transient and was
followed by a compensatory increase, possibly of adrenal origin .       
  cortisone administered within a month after the oophorectomy at a     
dosage of 50 mg per day rapidly depressed the secondary rise in the     
oestrogen output to a level of about 4 to 5 ug/24 h irrespective of the 
age of the patient . this excretion level was unchanged as long as      
cortisone was given in an adequate dose, but increased rapidly when the 
cortisone treatment was discontinued .                                  
  oophorectomy combined with adequate cortisone treatment seems to offer
an alternative to the extensive surgical porcedures undertaken to       
eliminate oestrogen production in breast cancer patients .

  the antiserum produced in c3h/he against c3h/st lymphosarcoma 6c3hed

on the value of thymectomy in adult mice as a means of potentiating the

  thymectomy has been found to be ineffective as a means of potentiating
the immunosuppressive action of melphalan in adult cba-p mice challenged
with a-strain mammary carcinoma transplants . this was true when the    
thymectomy was performed 2 days, 4 weeks or 7 weeks prior to injection  
of a single dose (15 mg/kg body weight) of melphalan, administered 24   
hours prior to tumour transplantation, and also when thymectomy was

studies on the kinetics of transplantation immunity .                   
  using the parameter of the number of tumor cells necessary to produce 
s.c. tumors in allogeneic animals at varying intervals after antigenic  
stimulation, immunity was found to be in force as early as 2 days after 
primary antigenic stimulation . it reached a peak at 8-10 days and had  
largely subsided by the end of a month . this method was also applied to
the quantitative study of the onset, degree, and duration of immunity   
elicited by skin grafts . the results obtained with inocula of large    
numbers of tumor cells (10 percent) were comparable to those obtained   
with massive skin grafts .                                              
  the differences in the degree of antigenic stimulation resulting from 
different routes of inoculation were studied . it was found that the    
intradermal (i.d.) route of inoculation resulted in a more intense      
antigenic stimulation than the s.c. route . when both routes of         
inoculation were used simultaneously the pattern of growth of the s.c.  
tumor was influenced by the i.d. inoculation.. an i.d. inoculum given 24
or 48 hr earlier caused marked suppression of growth of the s.c. tumor, 
while when an i.d. inoculation was preceded by an s.c. inoculation,     
although there was an appreciable effect on the growth size, the growth 
curves of the 2 tumors were always parallel .                           
  there was no correlation between cytotoxic activity and the degree of 
immunity in force at a given time .

evidence for an immunological reaction of the host directed against its 
own actively growing primary tumor .                                    
  cells isolated from primary benzo(a)pyrene-induced fibrosarcomas in   
rats of a pure line were tested for their ability to grow as autografts 
when injected back into the autochthonous host . the autograft did not  
take if the primary tumor had been removed but grew occasionally in     
animals in which the major part of the tumor was left . in every        
instance the sarcoma cells grew when injected into syngeneic recipients 
in these recipients the growth of the sarcoma cells was prevented or  
retarded when they were mixed in vitro, prior to injection, with spleen 
cells from animals that had been immunized against the tumor .          
autochthonous spleen cells taken from the animal with the tumor behaved 
in this test like those from immunized animals as long as the spleen was
taken 3 weeks after removal of the tumor . when the spleen and tumor    
were removed at the same time, however, autochthonous spleen cells did  
not behave like spleen cells from immunized animals and did not         
interfere with the growth of the tumor . the results of both the        
autograft and spleen cell experiments suggest that rats react actively  
against their own growing primary tumors, but that the tumor exhausts   
the supply of lymphocytes responsible for this reaction . after the     
tumor is removed, the concentration of antitumor lymphocytes in the     
spleen builds up and the animals can reject an autograft .-j nat cancer

equal . the average pressure difference was 22.6 mm. hg . the greatest  
differences occurred in cases of aortic regurgitation and could be      
extreme, the brachial artery systolic pressure exceeding that in the    
aorta by more than 100 mm. hg in some instances . the least differences 
occurred in cases of aortic stenosis but significant differences        
occasionally existed, leading to erroneous estimation of valve orifice

  rat brain increases in weight after birth in three stages.. (i)       
rapidly for the first 2 weeks, (ii) at a lower rate from 2 to 5 weeks,  
and (iii) at a still lower rate from 5 weeks to 5 months . during the   
succeeding period, designated iv, it maintains constant weight up to 1  
year of age . brain ganglioside content increased linearly during i and 
ii, more slowly during iii, and diminished during iv . the appearance of
measurable amounts of brain sphingomyelin and cerebroside succeeded that
of ganglioside .                                                        
  ceramide with c -sphingosine and c fatty acid was found in a large    
proportion of all three sphingolipids upon their first appearance in    
measurable quantity . c fatty acid in cerebroside rapidly declined to a 
negligible level, while in gangliosides and sphingomyelin it declined   
slowly but remained the major fatty acid component .                    
  cerebrosides and sphingomyelin contained c -sphingosine almost        
exclusively at all stages of rat brain growth . gangliosides contained c
-sphingosine almost exclusively at birth, but subsequently accumulated c
-sphingosine until they had nearly equal quantities of each base type . 
  changes in human brain gangliosides resemble those in rat . in

pregnant rat and also have a higher water content . the decrease in     
depot total fat,. elevation of serum, liver and kidney total fat,. and  
elevation of serum free fatty acids suggest that pregnancy induced      
mobilization of depot fat . the increase in proportion of liver and     
serum palmitate suggests that pregnancy induces increased lipogenesis   
from the acetate pool . the appearance of an increased amount of        
long-chain fatty acids in the liver may be due to the increased intake  
of dietary fat . the decrease in arachidonate and stearate in serum and

  the effects of nitrogen insufflation of the cannulated rumen were     
studied in 10 goats . parameters which were measured included cerebral  
blood flow, mean carotid arterial pressure, pressure in the confluence  
of sinuses, cerebrospinal fluid pressure, blood oxygen and carbon       
dioxide contents, packed cell volume (pcv), and hemoglobin concentration
values for cerebrovascular resistance and cerebral o utilization were 
calculated .                                                            
  increased ruminal pressure had little effect on cerebral blood flow   
and cerebrovascular resistance . cerebral o utilization was decreased   
when the intraruminal pressure was increased . this decrease was caused 
by a reduction in arterial o content and a consequent decrease in       
cerebral arteriovenous o difference . mean arterial, venous sinus, and  
cerebrospinal fluid pressures were increased as the intraruminal        
pressure was increased . increases in pcv and hemoglobin concentration  
were not related to the elevated intraruminal pressure .                
  central nervous system signs in goats with acute ruminal tympany may  
be caused by cerebral hypoxia . the nature of the hypertensive changes  
associated with increased ruminal pressure were demonstrated, but due to
the influence of multiple factors on fluid compartments, no conclusions 
could be made about the mechanism of these pressure responses .

mono- and divalent cations . of the cations tested, na at 2.5 to 5 mm .

nucleic acid metabolism in the lens iii. effect of x-radiation .        
  a previous communication reported an increased in vivo incorporation  
of p-32 into the albuminoid rna fraction of the rat lens 6 hours after  
the animal had been exposed to x-radiation (1,500 r) .                  
  in the present study, the in vitro uptake of p-32 and c-14-adenine by 
albuminoid, ribosomal, and soluble rna fractions of normal and x-       
irradiated rat lenses was measured . the rna fractions were extracted by
sodium dodecyl sulfate in 0.9 per cent nacl . the specific rna fractions
were also hydrolyzed, chromatographed (on paper), and the activity of   
the individual nucleotides (as well as the specific rna fractions) was  
determined . an experiment was also performed in which the capsules were
removed (after the 3 hour incubation period) and the activities         
determined in the nucleic acids extracted from the capsules and in the  
three rna fractions of the remaining lens matter .                      
  the results of these experiments indicate that the incorporation of   
p-32 and c-14-adenine into albuminoid rna was markedly stimulated 1 hour
after 1,500 r whole body radiation . there was no significant effect on 
ribosomal or soluble fractions .

lenses have been measured with a dynamic rheometer . the value for the  
apparent elastic modulus (young modulus) of the lens was found to be 10

  xylitol and sorbitol accumulated in the lens of the xylose-fed rat two
days before loss of adenosine triphosphate, and cataractous changes,    
were apparent . the maximum degree of cataract occurred when the level  
of the polyols was at its highest . regression of cataract was          
accompanied by decrease in polyol concentration and restoration of the  
level of atp . the lens of the xylose-fed rat did not usually increase  
in weight .

  the species-specific and organ-specific antigens of lens were

was found that rabbit antiserum to bovine lens showed cross reaction    
with other bovine tissues . these cross-reacting antigens were the b- - 
and y-crystallins . there were two major and a minor organ-specific     
antigen in lens . both the major antigens had a mobility and were       
identified as the a-crystallin of lens .

  changes in the morphology of cells during the regenerative tissue     
transformation of the pigmented epithelium of the iris into lens in the 
adult newt triturus viridescens were studied in ultrathin sections using
the electron microscope . in addition, quantitative analyses with       
electron micrographs were performed . the cells of the normal iris are  
characterized by an abundance of melanin granules, an extensive smooth--
surfaced endoplasmic reticulum, and irregular indentations of the       
nuclear membrane . after lens removal, the first visible changes are    
detected in nuclei of the mediodorsal iris cells and involve an increase
in the number of primary nucleoli . later, the nuclei enlarge and become
spherical, and prominent nucleoli appear . these nucleoli can be        
distinguished from the normal nucleoli by the presence of the granular  
cortex surrounding the fibrous core . the pigment granules seem to be   
completely extruded into the intercellular spaces and subsequently taken
up by leucocytes . the endoplasmic reticulum disintegrates gradually and
finally almost disappears . there is a significant increase of ribosomes
in the cytoplasm . later, the cytoplasmic matrix also acquires fibrous  
elements (about 50 a wide) of low density, probably corresponding in    
nature to the main components of a normal lens cell . these and other   
changes in the transforming cells are discussed .

  the fermented broth of a culture of alternaria tenuis auct. inhibited 
the growth of the human adenocarcinoma (h.ad. 1) in the embryonated egg 
with the aid of studies in the egg-tumor system the active agent was  
isolated and identified as tenuazonic acid . tenuazonic acid was        
produced by a number of alternaria isolates and by an aspergillustamarii
and a phoma sp . compared with tenuazonic acid, on a molar basis, about 
20 times as much hadacidin or 6-mercaptopurine, 2 times as much         
azaserine, but only 1/20 as much triethylenemelamine (tem) were required
to achieve the same inhibition of h.ad. 1 tumor growth in the egg .     
tenuazonic acid was more effective against h.ad. 1 than against another 
transplantable human tumor, a-42 . tenuazonic acid, compared with       
puromycin, more specifically inhibited tumor growth in the egg-tumor    
system .

of several other tissues with the exception of those from the kidney . a
'dialysis compartment' was not essential for the formation of the

a comparison of the fine structure of cultured mac-21 and hela cell .   
  the fine structure of a cultured mucoid adenocarcinoma cell of human  
lung (mac-21) is described and compared with the fine structure of the  
hela cell . the differences in fine structure between the two strains   
are primarily quantitative . the mac-21 cell differed, however, in the  
following respects.. a spindle-shaped cell with larger nucleus and      
increased nuclear membrane invaginations, and considerably larger       
amounts of perinuclear golgi apparatus . the cytoplasm contained areas  
of low density, undefined by a limiting membrane, which are thought to  
be accumulations of mucin .                                             
  the two cell strains contained numerous multivesicular bodies, some   
with lamellae in various stages of development, suggesting that these   
organelles may be involved in the formation of the lipide-rich,         
myelinated structures observed in both hela and mac-21 cells . the      
number of myelinated bodies was found to be inversely proportional to

in both the frontal and the parietal bones . except for one squamous--  
cell carcinoma of the lung which had some activity all other tissues    
tested as single fragments had no enhancing effect . on the other hand, 
all human tissues enhanced resorption when multiple fragments were      
placed in a halo around the calvarium, suggesting the presence of lesser
amounts of resorption-enhancing factors in other human tissues .

bacteriophages that lyse mycobacteria and corynebacteria, and show      
cytopathogenic effect on tissue cultures of renal cells of cercopithecus
aethiops.. a preliminary communication .                                
  bacteriophages isolated from sputum and resection specimens of pa-    
tients suffering from carcinoma of the lung were found to lyse coryne-  
bacteria and mycobacteria, and to produce a cytopathogenic effect on    
certain cells in tissue cultures . from the same and other patients with
neoplastic disease, bacteria were isolated and described as coryne-my-  
cobacteria because of bacteriological features they shared with both    
species . these bacteria, which either were sensitive to mycobacterio-  
phages and corynebacteriophages or were phage-immune lysogenic bacteria,
could be induced to produce lytic particles with phagolytic activity on 
corynebacteria and mycobacteria and a cytopathogenic effect on hela     
cells and on the renal cells of cercopithecus .

gel filtration of the soluble proteins from normal and cataractous human

  the soluble proteins of normal and cataractous lenses were separated  
according to their molecular size on the polysaccharide gel sephadex    
g-100 . in cataractous as well as in normal lenses 4 different compo-   
nents were obtained . during the evolution of cataract there is a pre-  
ferential decrease of the low molecular weight proteins of the lens .   
these disappeared completely in mature and hypermature cataract . on the
other hand, the proteins of high molecular weight (e.g., -crystallin)   
are very resistant to the pathological process . the electrophoretic    
pattern of the low molecular weight proteins in the normal lens revea-  
led several fractions distributed over a large mobility area . after    
immunoelectrophoresis, 3 different precipitin lines were obtained .

the insoluble proteins of bovine crystalline lens .                     
  the insoluble lens proteins, the albuminoids, of the adult bovine lens
cortex can be rendered soluble by raising the ph of their washed        
suspension in 0.9 nacl to 10.5 and then reducing it again to ph 7.4 .   
the sedimentation constant of the dissolved protein is 10.8 s,. its     
molecular weight is estimated to be 360,000 12,000 . the amino acid     
composition is approximately the same as that of the soluble -crysta-   
llin fraction, a kinship which is also apparent from their immunochemi- 
cal properties . it is suggested that the initial insoluble protein is a
molecular aggregate of -crystallin, which is dissociated in alkaline    
solutions to molecules exhibiting a sedimentation constant of 10.8 s .

either enzyme in the lens and their activity in the erythrocytes of the 
same species . there is a wide range of activity of both glucose 6-phos-
phate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase in the lens and
in the blood of different species . several species had glucose 6-phos- 
phate dehydrogenase activity in erythrocytes below the level considered 
/deficient/ in man . the sorbitol content of the lens was not correla-  
ted with glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity .

nucleic acid metabolism in the lens iii. effect of x-radiation .        
  a previous communication reported an increased in vivo incorporation  
of p-32 into the albuminoid rna fraction of the rat lens 6 hours after  
the animal had been exposed to x-radiation (1,500 r) .                  
  in the present stody, the in vitro uptake of p-32 and c-14-adenine by 
albuminoid, ribosomal, and soluble rna fractions of normal and          
x-irradiated rat lenses was measured . the rna fractions were extracted 
by sodium dodecyl sulfate in 0.9 per cent nacl . the specific rna       
fractions were also hydrolyzed, chromatographed (on paper), and the ac- 
tivity of the individual nucleotides (as well as the specific rna frac- 
tions) was determined . an experiment was also performed in which the   
capsules were removed (after the 3 hour incubation period) and the      
activities determined in the nucleic acids extracted from the capsules  
and in the three rna fractions of the remaining lens matter .           
  the results of these experiments indicate that the incorporation of   
p-32 and c-14-adenine into albuminoid rna was markedly stimulated 1 hour
after 1,500 r whole body radiation . there was no significant effect on 
ribosomal or soluble fractions .                                        
  the effect of formaldehyde and heating on x-irradiated albuminoid rna 
was much less than on the albuminoid rna derived from control animals .

ture . the inhibitory factor is associated with the y-crystallin frac-

protein synthesis and polyribosomes in the calf lens .                  
  a cell-free system capable of incorporating amino acid into protein

strands of ribonucleic acid, ranging from 7,000 a to 20,000 a, and con- 
taining a large number of ribosomes with an average diameter of about   
140 a .

  brain and cerebrospinal oxygen tensions have been measured in rats    
breathing air or in various high pressures of oxygen (ohp) . addition of
5 percent co2 to the inspired oxygen raised cerebral oxygen tensions    
when rats were exposed to 2 atm abs or above . inhibition of 75         
hemoglobin saturation by para-aminopropriophenone lowered cerebral po in
rats breathing air, but not in rats exposed to ohp . the rate of rise of
cerebral po to a steady level after rapid compression was found to be   
faster than the rate of fall to a steady level following decompression .
addition of co to the inspired gas mixture increased the rate of rise of
cerebral po . the anesthetics urethane and pentobarbital sodium did not 
affect cerebral po in rats breathing air or oxygen at 4 atm . the       
results are discussed in relation to factors contributing to oxygen

  summary the role played by mobilization of free fatty acids (ffa) from
adipose tissue in producing the typically high serum ffa levels of human
infants has been studied . ffa concentrations in the serum and subcuta- 
neous adipose tissue from the gluteal region were determined during     
postnatal development . a maximum level was reached within 24 hr after  
birth, after which there was a gradual fall . in serum the ffa level at 
the end of 12 months was still higher than that in adults, while the ffa
level in adipose tissue was lower at 3 months than in adults .          
  incubation of small pieces of adipose tissue in krebs-ringer phosphate
buffer containing 4 albumin led to release of ffa into the medium . this
release could be suppressed by the addition of glucose (200 mg/100 ml)  
for tissue from all age groups except the youngest (0-15 hr after birth)

in the presence of a normal pericardium . to appreciate these features, 
400 c. of radioiodinated human serum albumin and 50 c. of colloidal

  some of the characteristics of the erythropoietin stimulation of hemo-
globin synthesis by rat marrow cells in culture have been studied . the 
relationship between cell number and rate of hemoglobin synthesis at va-
rious levels of erythropoietin is sigmoid rather than linear suggesting 
a cooperative action among the sensitive cells . the magnitude of the   
erythropoietin effect on the cells increases with time of contact with  
the hormone,. at the time of one-half maximal effect there is no discer-
nible loss of erythropoietin from the culture medium . a previously des-
cribed lag time in the response to erythropoietin appears to be largely 
due to the conditions of culture and disappears when the cells are pre--
incubated for 9 h . replacement of a large fraction of the medium at    
24-h intervals enabled the cells to continue hemoglobin synthesis for an
additional 24 h .

moderate hypothermia in man.. haemodynamic and metabolic effects .      
  studies were performed on four patients undergoing intracranial opera-
tion during the induction and reversal of surface hypothermia to 30 c . 
oxygen uptake decreased an average of 26 per cent from 34 to 30 c to a  
mean value of 48 per cent of predicted basal uptake . at the same time, 
cardiac output decreased only 11.5 per cent, resulting in a consistent  
rise in calculated mixed venous oxygen saturation from a mean of 76 to  
81 per cent at 30 c . as a result of this and the effect of cooling on  
oxygen dissociation, the estimated tension of oxygen in mixed venous    
blood remained virtually unchanged . when shivering was allowed to occur
in two patients, oxygen uptake increased approximately 50 per cent      
without any concomitant increase in cardiac output . observed right     
atrial and svc oxygen saturations correlated well with calculated mixed 
venous oxygen saturations with regard to direction and magnitude of     
change with change in temperature .

  lupus nephritis, like sle, has a variable pattern of its own with a   
wide spectrum of renal involvement -dash evaluation of therapy and      
prognosis will have to be conducted against this background .           
  lupus nephritis may present as a renal syndrome only, without any of  
the other manifestations of sle .                                       
  renal involvement in sle is common, but this does not necessarily     
indicate a poor short-term prognosis . in the peter bent brigham

insufficiency influenced the prognosis adversely .

comparison of ultraviolet sensitivity of bacillus subtilis bacteriophage
spo2 and its infectious dna .                                           
  deoxyribonucleic acid extracted from a clear plaque mutant of the     
temperate phage, spo2, was infectious when incubated with competent     
cultures of bacillus subtilis 168 m . the relationship between numbers  
of infectious centers and dna concentration was linear .                
  the sensitivity of the infectious dna to ultraviolet light was much   
greater than that of the free phage when b. subtilis 168 m was used as  
host . acriflavin, which inhibits host cell reactivation, increased the 
rate of ultraviolet inactivation of the free phage so that it approached
the inactivation rate of the phage dna . acriflavin had little effect on
the survival curves of the infectious dna .                             
  non-host reactivating mutants (hcr ) of b. subtilis 168 m were        
isolated . the survival curves of spo2 phage were much steeper when the 
hcr mutant was used as a host than those obtained when the hcr parental 
strain was used as a host .                                             
  ultraviolet sensitivity of the phage dna was still greater than that  
of the free phage even when b. subtilis hcr was used as host, but the   
difference in sensitivity was much less than the difference obtained    
with b. subtilis hcr as a host .

the property of killing but not multiplying within a sensitive cell . a 
new morphological type of virulent bacillus phage was also isolated,.   
its head was oblong and the tail consisted of a short needle and a plate
the one acetobacter phage found resembled coliphage t3 but was of

bacteriol. 90..1655-1663. 1965.--a group of six phages, sp5, sp6, sp7,  
sp8, sp9, and sp13, which use the marburg strain of bacillus subtilis as
host was characterized . these phages, referred to as group 1, were     
examined for the following properties.. host range, plaque morphology,  
stability, adsorption kinetics, one-step growth characteristics, calcium
requirements, serum neutralization, thermal inactivation, and           
inactivation by ultraviolet irradiation . five unrelated b. subtilis    
phages, sp3, sp10, pbs1, sp alpha, and sp beta, were included in the    
studies . when first isolated, none of the group 1 phages was able to   
replicate efficiently on b. subtilis sb19, a mutant of the /transforming
/ b. subtilis 168 . host range mutants capable of growth in sb19 were   
isolated for all of the group 1 phages except sp13, and are designated  
the /star/ phages (sp5 through sp9 ) . for characterization, sb19 was   
used as host for the star phages, and another b. subtilis mutant, 168b, 
was host for sp13 .

transduction in bacillus subtilis .                                     
  (i) comparative examinations have shown that the temperate subtilis   
phages can be divided into two groups . b. subtilis strain nrs 231 was  
an adequate common host sensitive to all the examined temperate phages .
  owing to certain technical advantages this strain was found suitable  
for the titration subtilis phages .                                     
  (ii) some cultural differences have been revealed among substrains of 
b. subtilis 168 ind auxotrophs maintained in various laboratories .     
cells in one of these cultures were partly capable and partly incapable 
of using ammonia . ammonia assimilation was transducible to ammonia     
negative bacteria .                                                     
  (iii) after mitomycin c or ultraviolet ray induction the examined b.  
subtilis strains liberated /bacteriocin/-like principles . this finding 
is probably analogous to that of seaman et al. concerning pbsx defective
phages . on the basis of bacteriocin production the examined strains    
were divided into two groups .                                          
  (iv) several temperate phages isolated in our laboratory were         
presumably identical with phage pbs 1 . phage sp 10 differed from these 
agents both in antigenic structure and in host range .                  
  (v) transduction by some lysates of pbs 1-type phages was observed at 
frequencies of the order of 10 . considerably more and less effective   
phage materials were yielded by some lysogenic transductants . thus     
transducing phages active in the order of 10 were prepared .            
  (vi) transduction frequency, in addition to the properties of the     
phage, was influenced by the physiological condition of bacteria .      
  (vii) transduction of indole and histidine loci was studied by use of 
his derivatives of strain 168 ind .

the carrier state of bacillus subtilis infected with the transducing    
bacteriophage sp10 .                                                    
  bacteriophage sp10 may infect bacillus subtilis to form a carrier     
system . the infected bacteria give rise to infected organisms after six
or more successive single-colony isolations . about 60 of the spores    
derived from such an infected culture yield clones that produce phage,  
and such spores retain their ability to produce phage even after        
treatment with antiserum and heating at 80 . four hours' incubation of  
carrier spores in nutrient broth yields cultures having more than 10    
infective centers per bacterium . cultivation of infected organisms in  
medium containing sp10 antiserum leads to loss of phage and loss of     
immunity to phage infection . dna with a density characteristic of viral
dna can be detected in infected bacteria . extracts of infected bacteria
contain a phage-induced deoxyribonuclease activity which attacks both   
phage and bacterial dna in vitro . the phage-bacterial complex is       
therefore best described as a carrier state .                           
  the dna of the phage and of b. subtilis are chemically different .    
enzymatically prepared complementary virus rna has no homology with     
bacterial dna . the lack of homology of this transducing phage dna with 
the dna of its host and the failure to form a truly lysogenic           
relationship reinforce previous conclusions that transducing bacterial  
dna is incorporated into the sp10 virus particle without any            
recombination between viral and bacterial dna .

infectivity of dna isolated from bacillus subtilis bacteriophage, sp82 .
  sp82, a newly isolated bacteriophage of bacillus subtilis, is         
described . sp82 is closely related to sp8, but differs from sp8 in the 
density of its denatured dna and in its plating effciency on b. subtilis
strain sb-1 .                                                           
  dna isolated from this phage can be recovered in molecular weight     
equivalent to the amount contained in a single phage (approximately 130 
x 10 daltons) . dna of this molecular weight, but not half pieces, is   
infective in competent b. subtilis . the response of plaque-forming     
ability to dna concentration suggests that four whole molecules are     
required to initiate an infective center . recombination studies with   
mixed dna's of two non-allelic temperature-sensitive mutants confirm the
existence of an obligatory co-operative infective process . a second    
infective procedure that utilizes extracted phage dna is described . in 
this system, low concentrations of wild-type dna are exposed to the     
cells . at these concentrations the multiple-event nature of phage dna  
infection precludes the formation of unaided plaques . however, by      
subsequently superinfecting the dna-infected cells with a               
temperature-sensitive mutant and plating under selective conditions,    
genetic rescue of the infecting dna is accomplished and detected .      
infective centers elicited by this /marker rescue/ phenomenon are       
directly proportional to dna concentration . the time of attainment of  
dnase resistance by phage dna infective centers that have irreversibly  
adsorbed dna can be measured . phage dna infective centers require at   
least 13 minutes to become totally dnase resistant . the reasons for the
failure of single phage dna molecules to carry out an infection are     
discussed in terms of a specific breakage-reunion

psychology of children's dental treatment .                             
  the communication deals with influences involved in the development of
the child's attitude to dental treatment . they are extrinsic           
(educational etc.) and intrinsic (constitutional and hereditary) . their
understanding helps to determine the correct psychological policy for   
the management of the child in the surgery .                            
  the aim of psychology applied in dentistry is to discover a mode of   
treatment procedure which would ensure that the child will not be       
subject to any psychic traumatization (psychophylaxis) . its second aim 
is the management of the so called difficult child and his treatment .  
  to understand better the child's frame of mind during dental treatment
the situation in the surgery is dealt with step by step as the child    
experiences it through his senses and his psyche . beside the basic     
senses -dash hearing and seeing -dash others are also affected.. touch  
(pressure sensation), smell and taste .                                 
  children during dental treatment are nearly always in a state of      
raised emotional tension and are susceptible to anxiety reactions .     
according to the degree of fear which they manifest children may be     
classed into categories of cooperating and difficult patients . the     
psychological procedure for the treatment of children of both groups is 
based on the principles summarized in the section 'psychophylaxis in    
dentistry' . in difficult children it is often necessary to employ yet  
other psychological measures-psychotherapy, suggestion etc . in         
extremely exacting cases premedication helps sometimes to find contact  
with the child .                                                        
  the experimental part of the work demonstrates the following findings 
 1. dental treatment consists of a series of interdependent           
traumatizing impulses . many of them appear only after a close analysis 
of the situation . 2. the adverse response similar to that elicited by  
pain may be due also to sensory impressions with a negative emotional   
background . 3. psychic traumatization of the child during dental       
treatment can be prevented by relatively simple psychological measures .

relation of emotional changes during pregnancy to obstetric             
complications in unmarried primigravidas .                              
  this study was designed to assess the psychological changes           
experienced by white unmarried primigravidas during pregnancy, the      
relationship between manifest anxiety and clinical factors such as labor
time and mean birth weight, and the personality differences between     
/normal/ and /abnormal/ obstetric cases . the kent egy intelligence     
scale, the taylor manifest anxiety scale, and the mmpi were administered
to 160 obstetric patients at the beginning of the third trimester of    
pregnancy, with the mmpi and taylor being readministered post partum .  
reliable group personality changes observed from pre- to postdelivery   
supported the contention that pregnancy is a time of emotional upset .  
  following delivery, each patient was classified as normal or abnormal 
dependent on the clinical course of parturition, delivery, and condition
of the offspring . there were no significant differences between these  
groups with respect to age or intelligence . reliable differences were  
found, however, for manifest anxiety and total labor times . in         
addition, a positive relationship was found between manifest anxiety and
birth weights . personality differences found at predelivery between the
subgroups were largely attributable to the abnormal group's greater     
neuroticism, anxiety, and use of the ruminative ego defenses .          
  post partum, the personality characteristics of the subgroups were    
quite similar . both groups showed greater personality stability        
following delivery, with the most striking changes from predelivery     
demonstrable in the abnormal group . the magnitude of these changes were
interpreted as emotional lability and related to obstetric complications
by activation of various physiological regulator systems .

stranger and separation anxiety in infancy .                            
  anxiety responses to strangers and to separations from mother were    
studied longitudinally in 19 infants between the ages of three and 23   
months by direct observations and by interviews with the mother .       
benjamin's hypotheses concerning the differentiation and immediate      
dynamics of infantile stranger and separation anxiety were supported by 
the findings . differences in onset, period of highest intensity,       
termination, and ratios in individuals were found between the two       
anxieties . tests of the relationship between the two anxieties were    
supportive of deductive predictions made by benjamin . sex differences  
in intensity of the two anxieties were found .

mental retardation related to hypercalcaemia .                          
  for more than 20 years a number of retarded children and adolescents  
have been observed who show points of striking similarity . we recognise
in them a well-defined type that is clearly distinguishable from other  
forms of mental deficiency . they are therefore described in detail .   
some of the children have had infantile hypercalcaemia but it is assumed
that other aetiological factors are also involved .                     
  there is a characteristic facies and usually congenital heart disease 
ordination is poor . there is a constant failure to thrive in infancy,
with episodes of vomiting, often with constipation . mentally the       
children also show great similarities . their iq is about 40-50 but they
show outstanding loquacity and a great ability to establish interper-   
sonal contacts . this stands against a background of insecurity and     
anxiety .

psychological effects of circumcision .                                 
  in order to evaluate the psychological effects of circumcision, a     
small study was arranged in which twelve children, from average and low 
socio-economic level, were given goodenough dam test, cat, rorschach and
two sets of stories, prior to the operation and following it . the      
results of the tests showed that circumcision, performed around the     
phallic stage is perceived by the child as an act of aggression and     
castration . it has detrimental effects on the child's functioning and  
adaptation, particularly on his ego strength . by weakening the         
controlling and defensive mechanisms of the ego, and initiating         
regression, it loosens the previously hidden fears, anxieties, and      
instinctual impulses, and renders a feeling of reality to them . what is
expressed following the operation is primitive, archaic, and            
unsocialized in character . as a defensive control and protection       
against the surge of the instinctual forces coming from within and the  
threats coming from outside, the ego of the child seeks safety in total 
withdrawal, thus isolates and insulates itself from disturbing stimuli .
  the results of the study raised some questions concerning certain     
psychoanalytic formulations, for which further research was suggested . 
possibilities for future research were also discussed .

changes in children's behavior after hospitalization some dimensions of 
response and their correlates .                                         
  changes in 387 children's behavior following hospitalization were     
evaluated by means of a questionnaire sent to parents a week after      
discharge . factor analyses revealed that children's responses to       
hospitalization and illness were of six types.. (i) general anxiety and 
regression, (ii) separation anxiety, (iii) anxiety about sleep, (iv)    
eating disturbance, (v) aggression toward authority, and (vi)           
apathy-withdrawal . scores for these six factors (types of responses) as
well as a total score, were analyzed by univariate and, in most cases,  
multivariate analyses of variance . four variables -dash sex, prior     
hospitalization, degree of pain experienced during hospitalization, and 
birth order -dash were essentially unrelated to any type of response by 
any analysis . age, duration of hospitalization, and occupational status
were each significantly related to one or more types of responses .     
comparison of the mean factor and total scores for the full sample with 
the levels indicative of no overall change indicated that the           
combination of illness and hospitalization is a psychologically         
upsetting experience for children in general, resulting in increased    
separation anxiety, increased sleep anxiety, and increased aggression   
toward authority .

isozymes of lactic dehydrogenase.. sequential alterations during        
development .                                                           
  applications of isozymes in various biological contexts have been     
reviewed . diagnosis of several disease states has been facilitated by  
examination of the serum isozyme pattern which has been shown to        
correlate in some conditions with the isozyme pattern of pathologically 
involved tissues . physico-chemical studies of human ldh isozymes have  
revealed differences among isozymes in affinity for a given substrate . 
comparative studies of ldh isozymes within the erythrocyte from various 
vertebrate species demonstrated a marked species variation in the number
of ldh isozymes, in the distribution of total ldh activity among them,  
and in their electrophoretic mobilities . during development of chick,  
rabbit, and human tissues characteristic sequential alterations in the  
ldh isozyme pattern occurred and consisted for liver and muscle in loss 
of the most rapidly migrating anodal bands and increased activity in the
cathodal bands and slower migrating anodal bands . in heart the reverse 
changes were observed . if high enough ldh activities of early fetal    
tissue extracts were applied to the gel the full complement of ldh      
isozymes was observed,. however, in lower concentrations the cathodal   
bands, which in the starch gel disappear more rapidly on dilution than  
do the anodal bands, were not observed . a species-specific isozyme     
pattern is obtained in long term culture of rabbit, chick, and human    
cells . independently of the tissue of origin, there occurs in cells in 
culture a sequential series of isozyme alterations characterized by     
decreased intensity of rapidly migrating anodal bands . the shift toward
prominence of cathodal isozymes during both fetal development and tissue
culture can be explained by postulating the increased activity of the   
gene producing one of the subunits of ldh with a concomitant decrease in
the activity of the gene producing the second subunit . practical       
applications of the study of isozymes in tissue culture were discussed .

been stabilized to their epithelial shapes after the 35th transfer . the
cell atypy of the culture was remarkable . phagocytosis of the cell line
has not been observed . it was characterized that the intracytoplasmic  
droplets found in the original cancer cells have been maintained in the 
cultured cells, even in their mitotic stage, throughout the cultural    
course .

factors influencing development of tumors in frogs .                    
  (1) study of 75 spontaneous tumors of vermont frogs showed three      
pathological grades of malignancy present.. aggressive renal            
adenocarcinoma in some 30 per cent, medium adenocarcinoma in 50 per     
cent, and lower grade mixed with tumors of undetermined origin in the   
remaining 20 per cent .                                                 
  (2) correlation with parasite infections (trematodes) was demonstrable
in only few cases in the kidney . hyperplasias and neoplasias grading   
into lung primary carcinoma have been found in the lung in r. pipiens . 
temperatures below 15 c. protected animals from lung as well as kidney  
disease . higher temperatures disturbed the host-parasite relationships 
and led to higher incidence of malignancy . in the bullfrog, precancer  
was clearly associated with the worm attachment discs .                 
  (3) other histological types of tumors in vermont frogs included      
lymphosarcomas, liposarcoma, mesothelioma, epithelioma, and adrenal and 
cartilage tumors of uncertain malignancy .                              
  (4) improved methods of obtaining tumor filtrates allowed greater     
probability of inducing malignancy with direct renal injection . in 106 
frogs 37 per cent developed histologically provable cancers in the      
ranges of three to seven months . twenty-six per cent showed some       
pre-cancer response and 43 per cent were negative . within the series   
receiving filtrate from high malignancy donors one group yielded 100 per
cent positive, the others 50 and 38 per cent, respectively .            
  (5) among animals injected with /low/ malignancy filtrate, fewer      
tumors resulted . some of these were clearly vesicular carcinomas and   
could be classed as lung tumors .                                       
  (6) improved tissue culture methods allowed explants to live in liquid
media under perforated cellophane up to one year . slower growth, aided 
by lower temperatures (16 c.) improved the microecology of cell types   
and allowed detailed daily observations of each cell's intranuclear and 
intranucleolar physiology for extended time-lapse cine-photography .    
  (7) mechanisms for malignant transformation are related to increased  
activity and production of nucleolar dna and rna . the infective dna    
hypothesis is not classical virus theory, but it does offer detailed    
support .

mitotic lymphocytes in primary tissue cultures of normal and neoplastic

  normal and tumor tissue explants from 33 resected human lungs were    
studied in vitro . lymphocyte mitoses were observed in tissue cultures  
derived from 12 of the lungs . the ability of lymphocytes to undergo    
mitotic division in human lung tissue culture has not been reported     
previously . in the autologous systems used lymphocyte mitoses were much
more common in cellular outgrowths derived from non-neoplastic tissue   
than they were in the outgrowths derived from cancer-bearing explants . 
no differences were observed in the total number of nondividing         
lymphocytes present in the non-neoplastic and neoplastic preparations . 
the in ritro systems employed are promising tools for further           
contributions to an already well established clinicopathologic          
relationship between lymphocytes and cancer cells .                     
  phase contrast and time-lapse cinephotomicrographic records were      
obtained of the mitotic process and special attention was paid to the   
structural details . certain findings were of particular interest,      
namely the formation of a dense chromatin ring during telophase, the    
variable occurrence of cytoplasmic bubbling, and the death of           
lymphocytes during early metaphase (/exploding/ metaphase) . an

however, the most successful cases showed varying degrees of inhibition 
and retardation of lens regeneration .                                  
  4. pairs of eyes were united at large adjacent wound openings to      
provide a common reservoir of aqueous humor bathing both lenses and     
dorsal irises . in some cases the eyes were placed on the side of the   
body . in others more successful unions were made by fusing a           
transplanted eye to the right eye of a host .                           
  5. approximately three months after operation one of two large lens   
regenerates in a pair of perfectly fused eyes was removed . six weeks   
later a new large lens regenerate reappeared in most of the             
lentectomized units in the presence of the intact lens of the other unit
  6. there is a strong possibility that the more than normal amount of  
neural retina present provided a more powerful retinal factor for lens  
regeneration than the inhibiting influence of the intact lens in the    
environment .

correlation between the mast cells and histamine content of the eye in  
cattle .                                                                
  the authors have examined the mast cell content of the eyes of cattle 
and have established that most of the mast cells are contained in the   
conjunctiva, the optic nerve and the ocular muscles,. fewer occur in the
sclera and iris, and least in the ciliary body and choroid . cornea,    
lens and retina do not contain mast cells . the histamine content of the
ocular tissues and their mast cell contents generally run parallel .    
however, the cornea is exceptional in that its histamine does not occur 
in a bound state but in some form which is readily available to a mild  
process of extraction (tyrode solution at 4 c) .

studies in sickle cell anemia xxi. clinico-pathological aspects of      
neurological manifestations .                                           
  neurologic manifestations are frequent in patients who have sickle    
cell disease . these manifestations may be the earliest presenting signs
and symptoms and they are so variable that the patient may be           
erroneously diagnosed as having conditions such as meningitis,          
poliomyelitis, subdural hematoma, neoplasm, subarachnoid hemorrhage,    
lead encephalitis, subacute bacterial endocarditis, and congenital      
malformations of the brain . furthermore, development of these          
manifestations cannot be predicted on the basis of the type of crisis   
involved .                                                              
  prognosis following neurological involvement is unpredictable, but    
recurrent episodes, together with abnormal electroencephalographic      
readings suggest a poor outcome . such patients die or are the victims  
of rather severe neurological deficits .                                
  neurological examination of these patients suggests diffuse           
involvement of the cerebral hemispheres . examination of the            
pathological material, however, often fails to reveal thromboses . the  
striking findings are infarcts in the white matter and perivascular     
hemorrhages .                                                           
  the thesis that the abnormal neurological findings in these patients  
are actually due to sickle cell disease is supported by the fact that   
all such symptoms appear in association with clinical circumstances     
known to induce sickling . these include surgery and anesthesia, fever  
and infection .

attenuation curves of the human eye under normal and pathological       
conditions .                                                            
  a method is described which allows the determination of /attenuation  
curves/ of the human eye . those curves are obtained by plotting the    
critical depth of modulation (cmd) as a function of the critical fusion 
frequency (cff) . routine experiments were carried out for a 2 test     
field showing a sinusoidal periodical variation of its luminance,       
surrounded by an extensive area with a luminance equal to the average   
luminance of the test field . attenuation curves were obtained for      
normal observers under different experimental conditions and for a      
number of patients . it is shown that this method affords us information
which cannot be obtained by means of the classical methods for measuring
the cff .

central nervous system manifestations of periarteritis nodosa .         
  in the 114 cases of pathologically proved periarteritis nodosa        
reviewed, 53 patients (46 percent) had symptoms and signs of central    
nervous system or cranial nerve involvement . thirty-nine patients had  
both cerebral manifestations and neuropathy, 38 had neuropathy alone,   
and 14 had only cerebral symptoms and signs .                           
  the most common cerebral manifestation was that of mental derangement,
usually an organic psychosis or confusional state . headache,           
convulsions, blurred vision, vertigo, and sudden unilateral visual loss 
were the most common symptoms referable to the central nervous system . 
the most common abnormalities on examination were retinopathy,          
hemiparesis, and signs of a brainstem lesion . there was no difference  
in duration of life, after onset of disease, in those with and those    
without central nervous system involvement .

see-saw nystagmus an unusual sign of lesions near the third ventricle . 
  a case of see-saw nystagmus in a child with craniopharyngioma and     
bitemporal hemianopsia is described, and reference is made to previous  
case reports . the basis for this curious sign is not clear, but the    
site of the lesion must be considered to be in the region of the third  
ventricle, since bitemporal hemianopsia is a necessary part of the      
syndrome . the sign is not common but when present points to a lesion   
near the third ventricle .

implications of gerstmann's syndrome .                                  
  of 465 consecutive patients subjected to a standardized battery of    
neuropsychological tests, 111 had one or more components of gerstmann's 
syndrome . each of these 111 patients had some evidence of organic brain
dysfunction in addition to gerstmann components . as the number of      
gerstmann components increased, the responsible brain lesions tended to 
be larger, more highly destructive of tissue, and to cause greater      
neurological impairment . every patient with four gerstmann components  
had associated evidence of severe impairment of brain functions and the 
lesion or underlying disease was likely to compromise survival of the   
patient . the syndrome is not to be regarded as an autonomous entity,   
but merges with numerous other neurological deficits, notably dysphasia 
in agreement with benton, we find no justification for singling out   
the four gerstmann components as a separate syndrome, unless one is also
prepared to recognize that any other arbitrary groups of concurrent     
deficits are also separate syndromes .                                  
  in at least three of 23 patients with all four gerstmann components,  
the angular gyrus, as shown by necropsy examination, was not involved by
the lesion . however, the probability that the left hemisphere contained
a lesion increased with the number of gerstmann components, and the     
probability of involvement of the left posterior parasylvian area also  
increased with the increase in the number of gerstmann components . with
two, three, or four gerstmann components, the lesions were never        
restricted to the angular gyrus but tended to spread widely over the    
parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes . as to localizing significance,
gerstmann's syndrome has approximately the same degree of cogency as    
dysphasia .

  the visual evoked response (ver) was studied by means of computer     
averaging in 32 normal subjects, nineteen patients without visual       
disorder but with unilateral cerebral lesions, and 30 patients with     
homonymous visual field defects . an early negative-positive-negative   
complex was recorded between laterally placed occipital electrodes and a
vertex reference . latencies were prolonged in the hemianopic patients .
some amplitude asymmetries were noted in the brain-damaged controls but 
were more pronounced in patients with visual defects . the recordings in
the hemianopic patients were differentiated from those in both control  
groups by the presence of aberrant wave forms (2 cases),. prolonged     
latencies (3 cases),. and amplitude depression of greater then 50 per   
cent of the positive wave on the abnormal side (16 cases) . pathologic  
verification was obtained in three patients and demonstrated a          
correspondence between alterations in the ver and the presence of       
lesions of the geniculocalcarine system .

neurological disabilities have included aphasia, homonymous hemianopia  
and hemiplegia but have been remarkable for the degree of recovery which
has occurred . it is presumed that the livedo which has been found in

cerebrovascular incidents . investigations have failed to show any      
evidence of polyarteritis nodosa, disseminated lupus erythematosus and

  the author describes 6 cases of supratentorial paratransversal        
meningioma . clinically, the development of these tumours is slow and   
the chief neurological signs are.. homonymous hemianopia, contralateral 
hemiparesis and speech disorders when the tumour is on the dominant side
radiologically, carotid angiography permits identification of these   
tumours easily . surgically, the tumours were removed completely and,   
although in 2 cases the transverse sinus had to be resected, this caused
no damage . one patient, who was operated on twice and whose            
histological specimen on the second occasion showed that the meningioma 
was malignant, died seven months after the second operation . the other 
patients are well and free of neurological deficits from 1 to 12 years

both mouse strains when not given injections as new-borns manifest only

urinary excretion of neutral 17-ketosteroids and pregnanediol by

  urinary neutral 17-ketosteroid fractions and pregnanediol excreted by 
21 patients with prostatic cancer, 17 patients with benign hypertrophy, 
and 59 clinically well subjects were assayed to determine whether       
differences exist .                                                     
  patients with prostatic cancer and those with benign hypertrophy      
excreted significantly less androsterone than the clinically well       
subjects . a disproportionately lower level of androsterone than        
etiocholanolone resulted in a significantly lower                       
androsterone/etiocholanolone ratio in both groups .                     
  the specificity of the findings is discussed . the lower levels of    
androsterone excreted by patients with benign hypertrophy were          
associated with an extended period of hospitalization . patients        
hospitalized less than 5 days excreted androsterone at levels not       
significantly different from the clinically well subjects .             
  lower levels of androsterone excreted by patients with prostatic      
cancer were not explained by the presence of metastasis, the duration of
hospitalization, loss of appetite, or other definable differences, when 
each was considered singly . the possible interrelationships of clinical
differences prevent assigning lower excretion levels to the cancer state
alone .

from levels excreted by postmenopausal patients with breast cancer .    
  disproportionately lower levels of the 11-desoxy-17-ketosteroids than 
11-oxy-17-ketosteroids excreted by premenopausal patients with cancer

  the presence of an alveolar lining layer was histologically           
demonstrated in animal lungs by ultraviolet microscopy . this layer     
appeared as a thin fluorescent line at the air-tissue interface .       
  the fluorescent lining layer could be abolished from lung sections by 
extraction with chloroform..methanol and was diminished by digestion    
with cl.welchii a-toxin lecithinase, suggesting that the structure was a
lecithin-containing lipid . an alveolar lining structure was also       
identified by the use of phosphatide and polysaccharide stains,         
suggesting that the lipid was a phosphatide, but that a                 
mucopolysaccharide component might also be present .                    
  bilateral cervical vagotomy resulted in diminution or loss of the     
fluorescent alveolar lines and abnormal surface tension properties of   
lung extracts . this suggested that the presence of the fluorescent     
material was associated with the surface activity of the lung .

cells within the alveolar spaces was contributed to by monocytes of the 
circulation, mesenchymal cells of the alveolar walls and epithelial     
lining cells of the alveoli . the abnormal epithelial lining during the

time course of changes in surface tension and morphology of alveolar    
epithelial cells in co2-induced hyaline membrane disease .              
  atelectasis and hyaline membranes produced by exposure of guinea pigs 
to 15 percent co2 were found to be associated with disappearance of     
lamellar bodies in the large alveolar lining cells (granular            
pneumocytes) and an associated decrease in surfactant as indicated in   
the rise of minimal surface tension of the lungs . this process is      
limited to the uncompensated phase of respiratory acidosis and is       
reversed during the compensatory phase . the parallel time course in    
changes of surface tension and alterations of lamellar bodies in the    
granular pneumocytes provides additional evidence for the identification
of the latter as the cells responsible for the secretion of surfactant .

cortisone and atypical pulmonary /epithelial/ hyperplasia further       
studies including electron microscopy, tissue culture, animal           
transplantation and long term observations .                            
  previous work in rabbits showed that there was a proliferation of     
cells within pulmonary alveoli following intratracheal injection of     
nitric acid and that the proliferation was greatly enhanced by the      
administration of cortisone to the animals .                            
  electron microscopic observations indicated that these were           
morphologically large alveolar lining cells . tissue culture studies of 
damaged and normal lung with and without cortisone showed no evidence   
for a direct effect of the drug on the proliferation of these cells .   
  this observation, together with the knowledge that fibrosis was       
delayed in the cortisone treated animals, support the thesis that the   
cortisone effect is an indirect one . transplantation of damaged lung   
tissue to hamster cheek pouch failed to reveal evidence of growth .     
within the period of observation (99 to 420 days) there was evidence    
that the proliferation subsided considerably and no neoplasms developed

lactate/pyruvate ratio which is strongly increased in blood shows a     
small rise in brain . these observations could indicate that a different
mechanism is responsible for the rise of lactate in brain during hypoxia
and hyperventilation . the important augmentation of lactate in brain   
during hyperventilation can give an explanation for the delayed rise    
which is seen in the lactate level in cerebrospinal fluid in these      
conditions .

cisternal fluid oxygen tension in man .                                 
  using a beckman micro-oxygen-electrode we have studied the oxygen     
tension simultaneously in the cisterna magna, the internal jugular vein 
and in arterial blood under various conditions . the results suggest    
that the cisternal oxygen tension to some degree reflects the average   
oxygen tension of the surrounding brain tissue and besides reflecting   
the available free oxygen to the brain it registrates changes of short  
duration in the cerebral blood flow .

ventricular septal defect with prolapsed aortic valve and outflow tract 
obstruction .                                                           
  a case of ventricular septal defect combined with aortic valvular     
lesion and infundibular pulmonic stenosis is described . the right      
coronary cusp of the aortic valve, protruding through the ventricular   
septal defect, was demonstrated by right ventricular angiocardiography  
as a polyp-like mass in the right ventricular outflow tract . cardiac   
catheterization and angiocardiography showed progressive right          
ventricular outflow obstruction .

functional adaptations of the right ventricular outflow tract in        
congenital heart disease .                                              
  functional adaptations in the right ventricular outflow tract have    
been discussed in relation to the development of acquired /pulmonary    
stenosis/ .                                                             
  it is concluded that physical forces as well as structural            
abnormalities may greatly influence both the clinical picture and the   
life history of many patients with congenital heart lesions .           
  the importance of further serial haemodynamic studies to provide a    
fuller understanding of the natural course of many lesions is stressed, 
so that better advice about prognosis and the optimal time for surgical 
treatment may be given .

mitral atresia associated with pulmonary venous anomalies .             
  pulmonary venous anomalies were observed in 5 among 29 specimens with 
mitral atresia . in 4 of these 5 the anomalous pulmonary veins took the 
form of anomalous pulmonary venous connexion . in the remaining case the
pulmonary venous anomaly was represented by cor triatriatum . in 3      
(group i), mitral atresia and premature closure of the foramen ovale    
coexisted . the anomalous pulmonary venous connexions in this group     
provided collateral routes for the flow of pulmonary venous blood, and  
can be understood as developing en response to obstruction at the       
foramen ovale when the mitral valve is atretic . in the remaining 2     
(group ii) no such causative factor could be invoked . in one of the    
latter group total anomalous pulmonary venous connexion coexisted with a
common atrium . in the other, cor triatriatum coexisted with a patent   
foramen ovale .                                                         
  pulmonary venous obstruction occurred in each of the 5 cases .

basal metabolic rate after cardiovascular surgery .                     
  the basal metabolic rate and respiratory equivalent of patients were  
determined during 8 days of convalescence from cardiovascular surgical  
operations performed with or without cardiopulmonary bypass . the       
results were compared in patients who had undergone operation for       
different diseases . metabolic rate in the majority of cases was        
increased but was commensurate with body temperature . some patients,   
particularly those requiring open operation on the aortic valve, had    
raised metabolic rates which could not be explained solely by pyrexia . 
  all types of patients in this series had elevated respiratory         
equivalents which persisted throughout convalescence . these equivalents
were greater in patients treated with cardiopulmonary bypass than in    
patients treated without bypass .

surgical treatment of ventricular septal defect .                       
  the surgical technique of closure of ventricular septal defects in 80 
cases (37 cases of isolated defects and 43 cases of tetralogy of fallot)
is discussed in the light of the follow-up results . the use of a patch 
for closure has reduced the incidence of recurrence to 4 percent, com-  
pared with 18 percent when direct suture was performed . the incidence  
of heart block also decreased from 15 percent, when direct suture was   
used, to 4 percent with a patch . the transatrial approach is preferred 
for isolated ventricular septal defects,. the ventricular approach is   
preferred for cases with tetralogy of fallot . in cases combined with   
aortic insufficiency only small defects are closed through the aorta .  
larger defects are closed in the usual way at a first stage operation,  
and a total valve prosthesis is introduced at a second operation . there
was an operative mortality of 6 percent in isolated ventricular septal  
defects, compared with 27 percent in cyanotic patients with tetralogy of
fallot .

some hemodynamic observations in congenital heart disease with special  
reference to pressure curves in ductus arteriosus .                     
  hemodynamic observations in 100 congenital heart disease cases are    
made based on data in the department of pediatrics, kyoto university    
between may 1961 and december 1963 . we have classified these 100 cases 
according to the malformation from the hemodynamic view point . our     
cases were classified into the following groups .                       
  (1) ventricular septal defect                             35 cases    
      small ventricular septal defect                       20          
      moderate ventricular septal defect                     9

      ventricular septal defect with pulmonary stenosis      2          
  (2) patent ductus arteriosus                              21          
  (3) atrial septal defect                                  19          
      atrial septal defect                                  14          
      atrial septal defect with pulmonary stenosis           5          
  (4) pulmonary stenosis                                     5          
  (5) tetralogy of fallot                                   14          
  (6) aortic stenosis                                        3          
  (7) aortic insufficiency                                   3          
      aortic insufficiency with ventricular septal defect    2          
      aortic insufficiency with pulmonary stenosis           1          
  in sonre small ventricular septal defect, we tried the vasoactive     
drugs . phenylephrine was injected slowly into the right ventricle via  
the catheter, a rapid rise in femoral arterial pressure associated with 
bradycardia and intensiffication of the systolic murmur was observed .  
after the administration of amyl nitrite, a rapid fall in femoral       
arterial pressure associated with tachycardia and softening of the sys- 
tolic murmur was observed .                                             
  in patent ductus arteriosus, when the cardiac catheter is withdrawn   
slowly from the aorta into the pulmonary artery, the outstanding        
pressure curve is recorded in ductus arteriosus . the systolic pressure 
curve in the ductus arteriosus is the same as the systolic pressure in  
the aorta and the diastolic pressure curve in the ductus arteriosus has 
a diastolic dip followed by a late diastolic pressure peak .            
  in patent ductus arteriosus, when the cardiac catheter is withdrawn   
from the left pulmonary artery to the right ventricle, the pressure     
curve reveals a considerable characteristic rise in pulmonary arterial  
pressure which is regarded as an effect of the transmission of systemic 
pressure through the ductus arteriosus .

a study on the direction of inscription of the vectorcardiographic      
t-loop in left and right ventricular hypertrophy .                      
  (1) frank lead vectorcardiogram was recorded in 30 normal persons and 
in 323 cases with hypertension and acquired and congenital heart disease
the t-loop was classified into 8 types according to the directions of 
inscription in 3 planar projections . frequently observed types were    
examined with the direction of the maximal t vector .                   
  (2) in majority of normal cases, the t-loop was inscribed             
counterclockwise in horizontal and clockwise in sagittal planes .       
  (3) in left ventricular hypertrophy, abnormal inscription of the      
t-loop was observed with abnormal rightward and superior deviation of   
its maximal vector and the t-loop oriented more than 120 in horizontal  
plane was usually accompanied by abnormal inscription . percentage of   
abnormal inscription was higher in cases with cardiac complaints .      
  (4) in right ventricular hypertrophy, directional change of the t-loop
was relatively small but changes in inscription of it were common . the 
t-loop was always inscribed abnormally in cases with abnormal           
inscription of the qrs-loop .                                           
  (5) the concept of the polar vector was found to be valuable in       
studying the inscription and the direction of the t-loop . significance 
of changes in inscription of the t-loop was discussed .

pulmonary vascular plexiform lesion pathogenetic studies .              
  an attempt was made to test the theory that in pulmonary arterial     
hypertension, the plexiform lesion is a jet lesion beyond points of     
arterial stenosis resulting from nonspecific intimal thickening .       
  in 39 subjects with such congenital communications as are associated  
with pulmonary arterial hypertension, the lungs were studied            
histologically . in each, there was an additional element of pulmonary  
venous obstruction . it is likely that in the absence of pulmonary      
venous obstruction, adult patients with only the congenital             
communication would have developed plexiform lesions .                  
  in the three adult patients in the study, no plexiform lesions were   
identified . among the 36 infants or children, one subject showed       
plexiform lesions, a 53-day-old girl with mitral atresia, ventricular   
septal defect, and patent ductus arteriosus .                           
  while the findings in the three adult subjects support the theory     
regarding the genesis of plexiform lesions, the findings in the one     
infant with plexiform lesions appear to contradict it .

renal hemosiderosis (blue kidney) in patients with valvular heart

  anatomic evidence of intravascular hemolysis, i.e., renal             
hemosiderosis, was found at necropsy in 4 of 132 patients who died of   
severe valvular heart disease . the aortic valve in each of these 4     
patients was heavily calcified, immobile, and portions of the calcific  
deposits were in direct contact with the blood . hemolysis in each      
patient was attributable to direct trauma to erythrocytes traversing the
stenotic valve, and the frequency of trauma was increased by an         
associated regurgitant flow . renal hemosiderosis was not observed in   
any patient with isolated mitral valve disease, or in those with        
combined mitral and tricuspid valve malformations .

tumor scanning with radioactive cesium .                                
  fourteen patients with cancer were scanned 10 minutes to 48 hours     
after injection of radioactive cs. and satisfactory scans of the tumors 
were obtained in seven . positive scans were obtained in large,         
superficial tumors, in a pulmonary lymphoma, and in a carcinoma of the  
upper third of the esophagus . the negative scans were all in abdominal 
tumors . correlations were made with data obtained from external        
counting and by well scintillation counting of biopsy specimens . two   
modes of uptake are suggested.. (a) early uptake due to vascularity and 
probably not proportional to stable cesium content.. and (b) a later    
uptake based upon greater alkali metal content of tumors than of normal 
tissue .

lung scanning with colloidal risa .                                     
  the use of colloidal risa injected intravenously in a particle size of
10.50 microns followed by lung photoscanning offers a practical,        
atraumatic method of visualizing pulmonary artery occlusions in the dog 
the fact that the particles have a relatively short biological        
half-life appears to decrease the radiation dose delivered and the      
duration of occlusion of pulmonary capillaries as compared to ceramic   
microspheres . work is in progress to apply this technique to the study 
of pulmonary artery occlusion in the human .

multivariate comparison of results of treatment in chronic lymphocytic  
and chronic granulocytic leukemia .                                     
  the results of several clinical trials have been analyzed by          
multivariate procedures which rely completely on laboratory findings and
do not involve scoring specific changes or subjective evaluations .     
statistically significant differences among drugs after three months of 
therapy were demonstrated . a relationship between the multivariate     
method and the subjective evaluation was demonstrated which indicates   
that if the subjective evaluation is an estimate of the physiologic     
state or prognosis of the patient, then so are the completely objective 
techniques used here .

drugs and neonatal jaundice .                                           
  this paper is not intended as an exhaustive review of bilirubin       
metabolism nor of the many factors which may result in exaggerated      
physiologic jaundice.. for such a review the interested reader is       
referred to the excellent articles by zuelzer and brown . brief mention 
has been made of the mechanism by which certain drugs may contribute to 
the development of hyperbilirubinemia . a few drugs, the water-soluble  
vitamin k derivatives, sulfasoxazole (gantrisin), the salicylates, and  
novobiocin have been unequivocally shown to affect adversely the newborn
infant's ability to handle bilirubin . in time other compounds will     
definitely be incriminated .                                            
  it is important to remember that the administration of a drug to a    
mother just prior to delivery may result in appreciable concentrations  
of the compound in the infant's serum, and that drugs administered to   
the nursing mother may be excreted in breast milk and thereby absorbed  
by the infant . careful consideration of the drugs given not only to the
newborn but also to the mother is therefore essential if we are to avoid
what may be termed iatrogenic hyperbilirubinemia .

amputation in patients over 80 years of age .                           
  although patients over 80 years of age can be expected to have poor   
physical reserve and many co-existing diseases, our observations show   
that nevertheless they can be subjected to surgical procedures without  
undue mortality . the mortality rate can be maintained at a minimum if  
the surgeon considers the factors that contribute to its increase in the
elderly . this necessitates.. 1) careful evaluation of the patient and  
treatment of any pre-existing or co-existing disease, 2) proper control 
of electrolytes, 3) avoidance of infection, 4) prompt correction of any 
postoperative hypotension, 5) postoperative pulmonary ventilation and   
tracheal cleansing, and 6) avoidance of prolonged surgical procedures . 
  a group of 26 patients past the age of 80 years underwent amputation  
of a lower extremity, without undue mortality (9 deaths) .              
  lumbar sympathectomy is not considered advisable in these aged pa-    
tients .                                                                
  the standard mid-thigh operation can be questioned in the younger     
patient, but it is the procedure of choice for removal of a gangrenous  
extremity in patients over 80 years of age .

radical operation for ventricular septal defect in infancy .            
  ventricular septal defect is the most common congenital anomaly of the
heart in infancy, and has a poor prognosis . we have operated upon 18   
infants all under one year of age for ventricular septal defect . there 
has been successful repair in 16 cases .                                
  at present, hypothermia with a surface cooling method has proved to be
superior to the artificial heart-lung machine because of the simplicity 
and the good operative results with its use . in addition, early        
operation during the infantile period will cause less psychological     
impact on infants . these advantages are sufficient for us to advocate  
radical operation of ventricular septal defect in infancy, even         
including the severely ill children .

specific suppression of tumor growth by isolated peritoneal macrophages

  methods were presented by which macrophages may be isolated from the  
peritoneal cell population of mice . these cells, and for comparison    
peritoneal lymphocytes and lymph node cells, were tested for immunologic
activity by injecting a mixture of the test cells and tumor cells       
subcutaneously into irradiated mice . each cell type, when obtained from
immunized mice, was capable of suppressing the growth of the specific   
tumor cells . the results are discussed with respect to a possible      
specific immunologic function for macrophages in graft rejection .

effect of heterologous antiserum and complement on glycolysis of tumor

  the effect of heterologous antiserum and complement on glucose        
metabolism of rat ascites tumor cells was examined to clarify the       
mechanism of the cytotoxic effect of antibody .                         
  1. lactate-production of the target cells was inhibited by the        
cooperation of antiserum and complement, while no inhibition was        
observed when the cells were subjected to either antiserum or complement
alone . the inhibition of lactate-production was observed under both    
acrobic and anacrobic conditions . no effect of the antiserum and       
complement was observed on the oxygen consumption of the cells .        
  2. the amount of antiserum necessary for the inhibition of            
lactate-production of the cells was determined in the presence of a     
definite amount of complement, and it was found that the degree of      
inhibition was not in parallel with the concentration of antiserum      
beyond a certain threshold . on the other hand, a parallelism was       
observed between the amount of complement and the rate of inhibition of 
lactate-production when different amounts of complement were added to a 
definite amount of antiserum .                                          
  3. similar inhibitory effects of the antiserum and complement on      
lactate-production of the cells from glucose, fructose-1, 6-diphosphate,
and pyruvate suggested that the inhibition occurred toward the final    
step of glycolytic process of the cells .

soluble tissue antigens in human brain tumor and cerebrospinal fluid .  
  an a-2 globulin antigen present in human glioblastomas and            
immunologically identical with antigens present in human brain, liver,  
spleen, and metastatic carcinoma cyst fluid has been described . this   
protein antigen is not present in plasma, wbc, or normal csf . it has   
been demonstrated in the csf of three of 27 patients with tumors of the 
central nervous system . when present, it may represent a specific      
tissue protein fraction contributed by either the tumor itself or the   
adjacent cns tissue . the major protein components of normal and        
abnormal csf are derived from, or, at least, antigenically identical to,
the plasma proteins .

the apparent immunofluorescence of tissue mast cells .

g-globulin and in each cell this fluorescence was immunologically

the determinants of cerebrospinal fluid po2 the effects of oxygen and

  the lumbar cerebrospinal fluid po2 of some hypoxemic hypercapnic      
patients with chronic lung disease is the same as that of patients      
without chronic lung disease . breathing 95 oxygen with 5 carbon dioxide
increased lumbar cerebrospinal fluid po2 more than breathing 95 oxygen  
with 5 nitrogen . the change in cerebrospinal fluid po2 is closely      
related to the change in arterial pco2, and this relationship is similar
to the relationship between arterial pco2 and cerebral blood flow in    
patients with and without hypercapnia . interpretation of these         
observations must be qualified by the following.. cisternal             
cerebrospinal fluid po2 differs from lumbar cerebrospinal fluid po2 in  
its response to breathing oxygen with carbon dioxide,. regulation of    
blood flow to the spinal cord and nerve roots is not known to be        
comparable to that of the brain,. and factors other than blood flow may 
have contributed to the changes of cerebrospinal fluid po2 .

the behavior of lymphocytes in primary explants of human lung cancer in 
vitro .                                                                 
  the activity of lymphocytes within outgrowths from explanted tissue   
fragments of 20 human lung cancers has been studied . the study included
cancer-bearing tissue explants from all cases and noncancerbearing lung 
tissue from 4 of the 20 cases . five major categories of lymphocytic    
behavior were derived from the study, namely.. (1) emigration and       
migration of lymphocytes from the explant,. (2) clustering of           
lymphocytes around /target/ cells,. (3) ameboid transformation of       
lymphocytes,. (4) lymphocytic congregation,. and (5) emperipolesis .    
criteria for these different lymphocytic activities have been amplified 
or introduced .                                                         
  findings of particular interest were.. (1) the frequency of both via  
ble and nonviable lymphocytes within the vacuoles of other cells . this 
observation is considered to be an absolute criterion for the recogni-  
tion of emperipolesis . a subsequent /inclusionbody/ appearance of the  
dead lymphocytes has been observed . (2) the intimate relationship of   
ameboid forms of lymphocytes to selected cells, resulting in a          
juxtanuclear and frequently unipolar crowding of one cell by numerous   
lymphocytes while nearby cells were totally devoid of ameboid           
lymphocytes . reasons are given to support the impression that this     
phenomenon is re lated to sensitization . there is also the possibility 
that the phenomenon may indicate that the lymphocyte is /conditioned/ . 
(3) the apparent entry of the lymphocyte into the cell has been recorded
by timelapse cinematography .                                           
  a lymphocyte relationship to cancer cells was infrequently found      
although explants of 15 of the 20 cases produced identifiable cancer    
cells and lymphocytes emigrated from the explants of all 20 cases . it  
is not apparent from this limited study whether this is a significant   
finding .

ventricular septal defect with aortic insufficiency a clinical and      
hemodynamic study of 18 proved cases .                                  
  eighteen patients with the combination of ventricular septal defect   
and aortic insufficiency were studied . nine also had infundibular      
pulmonary stenosis . seventeen were treated by open-heart operations .  
  the physical findings were those of a typical ventricular defect      
murmur and thrill together with an aortic insufficiency blow and a wide 
pulse pressure . a systolic murmur at the upper left sternal border with
thrill is strongly suggestive of the additional lesion of infundibular  
pulmonary stenosis, but the presence or absence of infundibular         
pulmonary stenosis was indicated most accurately at cardiac             
catheterization and on inspection at operation . it was not of          
sufficient severity for signs of additional right ventricular           
hypertrophy to appear on the electrocardiogram .                        
  retrograde aortography serves to demonstrate the severity of the      
aortic regurgitation .                                                  
  the problem of the surgical correction of these lesions will be the   
subject of a separate communication .

radioisotope photoscanning as a diagnostic aid in cardiovascular disease
a safe, simple method for diagnosing pericardial effusion and aneurysm .
  radioisotope scanning is a safe, simple, and useful method for the    
diagnosis of pericardial effusion and aortic aneurysm . the whole-body  
radiation dose, approximately 25 millirads from 300 of i 131-sodium     
iodipamide, is no greater than the dose received from a standard        
posteroanterior chest roentgenogram or a blood volume determination .   
there are no side effects or complications from the procedure, and it is
well tolerated by the patient . the scan can be repeated at intervals to
assess progress of the disease or response to treatment . cardiovascular
scanning with radioactive isotopes can be recommended as a useful and   
safe diagnostic tool .

  forty-four pigs were used in two experiments whose purpose was to     
produce a deficiency of vitamin e . the anemia and changes in bone      
marrow morphology occurring in the vitamin e-deficient state are        
described . the hematologic disorders include low hemoglobin and        
hematocrit values, leucocytosis and granulocytosis . nuclear            
abnormalities were observed in the erythroid precursors in the bone     
marrow, many of the cells being multinucleated . giant multinucleated

significance of blood groups in homotransplantation of marrow in the dog
  ten dogs were given 1,500 r whole-body irradiation and an infusion of 
allogeneic marrow from a donor matched with respect to six erythrocyte  
antigens . methotrexate was given to reduce secondary syndromes . four  
dogs survived . in a similar experiment with 10 dogs, in which no effort
was made to match donors and recipients, three dogs survived . it was   
concluded that matching of donor and recipient for these six red cell   
antigens did not increase significantly the longterm survival rate of   
lethally irradiated dogs with allogeneic marrow grafts .

radioautographic studies of bone marrow lymphocytes in vivo and in      
diffusion chamber cultures .                                            
  radioautography with tritiated thymidine has been utilized to examine 
the turnover rate and origin of small lymphocytes in the bone marrow of 
the guinea-pig .                                                        
  very few marrow lymphocytes were initially labeled by a single        
injection of tritiated thymidine, but thereafter the number of labeled  
lym phocytes rapidly increased to high maximum levels at 3 days .       
analysis of the labeling curves and grain counts indicates that the     
population of marrow lymphocytes is maintained in a dynamic steady state
with an average turnover time of 3 days or less .                       
  suspensions of bone marrow cells were isolated from the circulation   
within intraperitoneal diffusion chambers after short-term labeling with
tritiated thymidine in vivo . although very few small lymphocytes were  
labeled when introduced into the diffusion chambers, a considerable     
percentage became labeled during the subsequent culture period .        
  tritiated thymidine was also administered intravenously whilst        
excluded from one hind limb by the application of an occlusive          
compression bandage for 20 minutes . very few labeled small lymphocytes 
were found after 72 hours in the tibial marrow of the initially occluded
limb, whereas the normal high percentage was labeled in the control     
tibial marrow .                                                         
  these experiments do not demonstrate any large-scale influx of small  
lymphocytes from the blood stream into the marrow parenchyma . they     
suggest that newly formed small lymphocytes appear in the marrow as a   
result of the division of locally situated precursor cells, but the     
mechanism of intramedullary lymphocytopoiesis is uncertain .            
/transitional/ cells, intermediate in morphology between blast cells and
small lymphocytes, synthesize dna and are actively proliferative, but   
they do not appear to account fully for the rate of lymphocyte          
production .                                                            
  certain large, undifferentiated labeled cells appeared in the bone

autoradiographic study on the origin and fate of small lymphoid cells in
the dog bone marrow.. effect of femoral artery clamping during in vivo  
availability of h3-thymidine .                                          
  the origin and fate of small lymphoid cells in the dog bone marrow    
were studied autoradiographically by observing the effect of clamping of
the femoral artery during in vivo availability of h3-thymidine . heavily
labeled small lymphoid cells appeared in the bone marrow of the clamped 
leg 3 hours after injection of the tracer and increased in number up to 
6 days . the labeling indices of these cells, however, were             
significantly lower than those of control marrow . a possible           
interpretation is that dog bone marrow contains two populations of small
lympho id cells, one migrating into the marrow via the blood stream, the
other originating from local precursor cells within the marrow . there  
was no evidence for a transformation of migrated small lymphoid cells   
into erythroblasts during the first 48 hours after injection of         
h3-thymidine .

the lymphocyte in guinea-pig bone marrow .                              
  the structure and distribution of lymphocytes in the bone marrow of   
normal 400 g guinea-pigs have been studied by means of light microscopy,
electron microscopy, and radioautography . the study of structural      
organization by all three techniques confirms the morphological identity
of the marrow small lymphocytes with small lymphocytes in other         
situations and affords added proof of the presence of a series of cells 
transitional in appearance between small lymphocytes and blast cells .  
unlike the small lymphocytes, transitional cells show evidence of dna   
synthesis . marrow small lymphocytes and transitional cells are         
diffusely scattered throughout the parenchyma, often situated in close  
proximity to the sinusoidal endothelium . they are also found           
characteristically concentrated within some of the sinusoids,. this is  
termed /lymphocyte loading/ .

surgical treatment of atrial septal defect under hypothermia .          
  the technique of inflow occlusion under 30 c. hypothermia was adopted 
for direct visual correction in 133 consecutive cases of atrial septal  
defect of the secundum variety and the associated anomalies .           
  the use of extracorporeal circulation combined with hypothermia was   
reserved for the repair of two cases of ostium primum defects .         
  the over-all operative mortality was 4 .                              
  post-operative evaluation showed that the results have been good in   
almost all patients, including those with pulmonary hypertension .      
  since an ostium primum defect requires cardio-pulmonary bypass for its
closure, the pre-operative recognition of the defect is highly desirable
in the selection of patients for operation and in planning the procedure
itself .                                                                
  the information derived from the clinical examination and appropriate 
diagnostic studies has been found to be consistently accurate in the    
pre-operative differentiation of the primum from the secundum defect .  
therefore, the unexpected discovery of a primum defect at operation was 
not a problem .                                                         
  in our experience, open-heart surgery under 30 c. hypothermia for the 
repair of an atrial septal defect of the secundum type and the          
associated anomalies is a safe and practical technique and effectively  
corrects the anomaly with minimal risk .

late effects of regional renal hypothermia .                            
  in summary, one can safely conclude that no deleterious effects were  
created in dogs observed over a period of 3 years following renal       
ischemia of 6 hours' duration protected by hypothermia . the blood      
pressure failed to climb, there was no evidence of azotemia, and careful
microscopic studies failed to reveal histological evidence of renal,    
vascular or cardiac damage . renal function, as demonstrated by         
creatinine and pah, was preserved and there was no delay in wound       
healing .

epinephrine on these resistances were compared .                        
  2. cooling to 15 c. caused an increased mesenteric resistance in 94   
per cent of animals with approximately 90 per cent of the resistance    
rise contributed by the arterial segment . small vessel resistance      
increased in 52 per cent . there was no evidence of venous constriction 
  3. blood viscosity appeared to play a minor role .

2803. effect of dosage on endotoxin-induced changes in the reticuloendothelial
system of rabbits
tissues were removed from rabbits 4
and 24 hr. following an i.v. injection of 5,
25, or 200 ug of endotoxin.  explants of
tissues from normal and injected animals
were grown in a coagulated plasma medium
and in medium containing 1 ug/ml of
endotoxin.  the migration and growth of cells
were observed during the following week
of incubation.  the inhibition or stimulation
of cells of the reticuloendothelial system
(res) at different host sites after endotoxin
administration depended on the dosage
and on the known capacity of different organs
to take up circulating endotoxin.  macro-
phage migration was suppressed in cultures
of spleen removed 4 hr. after a dose of
hibited by 200 ug, but macrophages in
lymph node, testis, and thymus showed an in-
crease in numbers, in extent of migration
and in phagocytic activity.  widespread
res stimulation was seen in tissues removed
24 hr after the largest dose.  in ad-
dition to the restoration of re cell activity in
spleen and lung there was a marked
increase in the migration of large phagocytic
cells from bone marrow, as well as
other organs.  macrophages from endotoxin-injected
animals were as sensitive as
normal macrophages to added endotoxin in vitro.

3075. vaccinia pneumonia in mice.  a light and electron microscopic and viral
assay study
swiss white mice between 2 and 4 days of age
developed generalized vaccinia viral
infection 2 to 7 days after intranasal inoculation.
gross and histologic evidence of
pneumonia was seen in more than 80% of
approximately 300 mice.  virus was re-
covered in relatively high titers from the
lungs (10   pfu per g) during the per-
iod when pneumonia developed; viremia
was also present, but virus titers in the
blood stream remained much below those
in the lungs.  histologically, vaccinia
pneumonia was characterized by large swollen
mononuclear cells giving rise to
marked widening of alveolar septa.  only
scattered neutrophils were noted, usually
in association with cell necrosis.  exudation
of edema fluid and red cells into al-
veoli was considered the result of viral
replication and cytopathic effect on cells
comprising alveolar septa.  various forms
of vaccinia virus were observed by elec-
tron microscopy within both 'type i' and
'type ii' alveolar lining cells, capillary
endothelial cells, and interstitial cells
within alveolar walls.  these infected inter-
stitial cells were probably derived from
fixed macrophages and were noted also
around bronchioles.  virus particles were
similarly observed in bronchiolar epi-
thelium and surrounding smooth muscle
cells.  the earliest pathologic ultrastruc-
tural change noted in virus infected cells
was intracellular edema, evidenced by
low electron density of the background
cytoplasmic material and dilatation of the
endoplasmic reticulum.  more extensive
changes resulted in cell necrosis with
release of virus particles into the extracellular space.

1161. electron microscopy of the bovine lungs  lattice and lamellar structures
in the alveolar lumen
in an electron microscopic study of samples
from the lungs of 20 normal cattle,
and from 4 with high mountain disease, lattice
and lamellar structures were obser-
ved free in the alveolar lumens in 25% of the
normal cattle and in 100% of those with
high mountain disease.  in one specimen, a
lattice and lamellar structure was ob-
served in a vacuole within an alveolar epithelial
cell.  all others were extracellular.
the shape and dimensions of these lattice and
lamellar structures were similar to
those described by other workers in experiments
involving intratracheal injections
of silicon and oleic and linoleic acid.  this is the
first report of the structures free
in the alveolar lumens of apparently normal cattle.

1162. electron microscopy of the bovine lungs  the blood-air barrier in acute

electron microscopic studies of experimentally

alveolar epithelial edema and cyto-

excessive elastic and collagenous alveo-
lar wall fibrosis, hyperplasia of alveolar
wall smooth muscle, numerous intra-
alveolar lattice and lamellar bodies, hyaline
membrane formation, hypertrophied
endothelial perikaryons, numerous alveolar
macrophages, and alveolar epithelial
secretion of an electron-dense amorphous mass.
it was postulated that the lattice

alveolar epithelial cells.

1560. the ultrastructure of the lungs of lambs.  the relation of osmiophilic
inclusions and alveolar lining layer to fetal maturation and experimentally
produced respiratory distress
the lungs in 69 fetal and newborn lambs
were studied.  osmiophilic inclusion bodies
first appeared at about 121 days gestation
and their total number increased with
maturation.  normal surface activity of
lung extracts was detectable a few days
following the appearance of inclusion
bodies.  the excretory nature of the type ii
alveolar epithelial cell, the phospholipid
nature of the inclusion body content, the
decrease in the number of inclusion
bodies and their loss of density associated
with respiratory distress and with the
loss of normal surface activity of lung ex-
tracts provide strong evidence that
inclusion bodies are the source of pulmonary
surfactant.  a dense osmiophilic alveolar
lining layer in mammals is described.
since the presence of such a layer is
well correlated with surface tension values
and the number of inclusions, it is
suggested that this layer consists of surface
active substances.  the difficulty in
detecting such an osmiophilic layer in other
mammals is thought to be, at least
in part, due to species differences in the compo-
sition of materials constituting the
pulmonary surfactant.  cytologic immaturity
exists until lamb fetuses reach 135
days gestation.  this is considered to be the
basis for the susceptibility of immature
lambs to respiratory distress.  fibrin with
230 a periodicity is a component,
although a small one, of hyaline membranes in
lambs.  in view of the fact that mature
fibrin appearing as bundles of fibrils is rare-
ly found, it is suggested that the bulk
of the hyaline membrane is not a mature fi-
brin, but probably consists of polymers
of fibrinogen and serum protein.

that it had not been previously described.

interstitial pneumonia is submitted.  clinical,
roentgenologic and histopathologic mani-
festations are tabulated for each condition
and the differences between them are em-
phasized.  additional symptoms, changes
and phenomena not previously recorded are
introduced.  the most distinctive differences
between the 2 diseases were found in

3831. lysosomes in the rat sciatic nerve following crush
peripheral nerves undergoing degeneration
are favorable material for studying the
types, origins, and functions of lysosomes.
the following lysosomes are described
(a) autophagic vacuoles in altered schwann
cells.  within these vacuoles the myelin
and much of the axoplasm which it encloses
in the normal nerve are degraded (wal-
lerian degeneration).  the delimiting
membranes of the vacuoles apparently form
from myelin lamellae.  considered as
possible sources of their acid phosphatase are
golgi vesicles (primary lysosomes), lysosomes
of the dense body type, and the endo-
plasmic reticulum which lies close to the vacuoles.
(b) mebranous bodies that accu-
mulate focally in myelinated fibers in a zone extending
2 to 3 mm distal to the crush.
these appear to arise from the endoplasmic reticulum
in which demonstrable acid
phosphatase activity increases markedly within 2 hours
after the nerve is crushed.
(c) autophagic vacuoles in the axoplasm of fibers
proximal to the crush.  the break-
down of organelles within these vacuoles may have
significance for the reorganization
of the axoplasm preparatory to regeneration.
(d) phagocytic vacuoles of altered
schwann cells.  as myelin degeneration begins, some
axoplasm is exposed.  this
is apparently engulfed by the filopodia of the schwann
cells, and degraded within the
phagocytic vacuoles thus formed.  (e) multivesicular
bodies in the axoplasm of myelina-
ted fibers.  these are generally seen near the nodes of ranvier.

2431. histochemistry of surface epithelial and pleural mucins in mammalian
lung.  the demonstration of sialomucin in alveolar cuboidal epithelium
sialo- and sulfomucins have been demonstrated
histochemically in the surface
layer of the lung and pleura from rabbit,
syrian hamster, guinea pig, mouse, and
man.  sialomucin predominates in the distal
bronchial tree and covers the alveolar
epithelial surface.  the possible significance
of these observations is discussed.

617. maturation of postnatal human lung and the idiopathic respiratory distress
syndrome
maturation and pathologic alterations of the lung
in 19 newborn infants who died of idiopathic respiratory
distress syndrome were studied by light-and electron
microscopy.  normal lungs from 6 fetuses and 11 new-
borns served as controls.  in all infants with idiopathic
respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory bronchio-
les and alveolar ducts usually presented the histologic
pattern of mature lungs, i.e. they were predominantly
lined by type i cells, which also formed the epithelial
component of most blood-air barriers.  well expanded
alveoli exhibited a similar pattern, whereas collapsed
alveoli were lined by numerous type ii cells which par-
ticipated in the formation of poorly developed blood-air
barriers.  the capacity of type ii cells to produce in-
clusion bodies seemed to increase with survival beyond
the 14th hr of age.  secretion of inclusion bodies and
presumably surfactant into alveolar spaces did occur
but only in the lungs of infants older than 2 days.  how-
ever, this process was not accompanied by reduction
in the number of type ii cells per alveolus as in the nor-
mal lung.  the distribution of pathologic changes in idio-
pathic respiratory distress syndrome appeared to be
determined by the degree of maturity of the air sacs.
structurally mature air sacs were associated with da-
mage of epithelial lining and hyaline membrane forma-
tion.  in contrast, collapsed alveoli revealed an intact
epithelial lining and marked septal edema but were free
of hyaline membranes.  the findings of this study sug-
gested that transudation of plasma through well develop-
ed blood-air barriers was responsible for epithelial
damage and hyaline-membrane formation in air sacs.
they also suggested that alveolar collapse and presuma-
bly lack of surfactant were related to abnormal matura-
tion of the epithelial lining and to septal edema.

903. lattice structures and osmiophilic bodies in the developing
respiratory tissue of rats
osmiophilic inclusions have been observed in the
lungs of rats particularly in the 20-day rat embryo and
newborn up to 3 days post partum.  these inclusions
are present in the large alveolar cells as dense lamin-
ated structures of variable size and configuration.  they
generally consist of concentrically arranged membranes
and have the appearance of myelin figures, usually with
a dense center.  these osmiophilic inclusions are fre-
quently seen in direct contact with the cell membranes
and the alveolar space.  the alveolar space contains
numerous osmiophilic myelin figures which are thought
to originate from the intracellular osmiophilic inclu-
sions.  they may extrude through a channel formed in-
side the cell or by rupture of the cell membrane.  secre-
tion materials may occasionally be seen in the cyto-
plasm of the large alveolar epithelial cells.  these cells
appear to be in the process of degeneration.  their cell
surfaces are disrupted and the cytoplasm is continuous
with materials in the air space.  the lattice structure
in the alveolar space may originate from the cytoplas-
mic secretion material.  the cytoplasmic secretion ma-
terial in the cell and the lattice structures in the air
space disappear after the rats are 3 days old.  (i,t*)

454. xanthogranuloma (xanthoma) of choroid plexus.  the origin of foamy
(xanthoma) cells
a case of a 3-month-old infant with intense pro-
liferation of choroidal epithelium with foamy cells, a
second similar case in a 9-month-old infant with gener-
alized glycogen storage disease and a case of a 51-year-
old male with bilateral xanthogranuloma of choroid
plexus and proliferation of the choroidal epithelial cells
are discussed.  the pathogenesis of the foamy xanthoma
cells in the stroma of the choroid plexus, particularly,
is discussed.  the authors believe that the origin of foamy
cells and the mode of formation of such a xanthogranuloma
can be explained by the proliferative capability and the
phagocytic activity of the choroid epithelium.  choroidal
epithelial cells can be regarded as fixed macrophages
which becomes wandering phagocytes after detachment.
disintegration of these foamy cells then releases the
lipid content into the interstitium and provokes a re-
sponse of macrophages and multinucleated giant cells
of the foreign-body type.  hemorrhage is also considered
as a factor involved in the formation of xanthogranuloma.

4. mixed hematopoietic and pulmonary origin of 'alveolar macrophages' as
demonstrated by chromosome markers
the origin of alveolar macrophages was investiga-
ted in mouse chimeras in which the hematopoietic cells
could be identified by marker chromosomes.  by chro-
mosome analysis it was found that in both normal lungs
and in lungs exposed to an irritant, approximately two-
thirds of the dividing cells which could be recovered by
lung washing arose from the hematopoietic system and
one-third were of pulmonary origin.

632. pulmonary alveolar proteinosis.  a study using enzyme histochemistry,
electron microscopy, and surface tension measurement
lung biopsies from 4 patients with pulmonary al-
veolar proteinosis were studied using histochemical me-
thods, electron microscopy, and surface tension mea-
surement.  the lipid-rich intraalveolar fluid contained
material with the staining reactions and ultrastructure
of phospholipid.  although many alveoli were lined by
enzymatically active, secreting granular pneumonocy-
tes, extracts of proteinotic tissue were not surface
active, and, in fact, inhibited normal surfactant.  some
of the cells free in the intraalveolar material were de-
generating sloughed granular pneumonocytes.  at the
margins of the lesions were lipid-filled macrophages
which appear to play a role in the removal of the mate-
rial.  these observations indicate that alveolar protein-
osis is not a primary overproduction of surfactant and
are consistent with the concept that the alveolar clear-
ing process is defective in this disease.

1688. surface phenomena in lungs in health and disease
in summary, the authors have attempted
to bring together the multiple observations
which seem germane to the understanding
of surface phenomena in lungs in health
and disease.  to this end, the contributions
of anatomists and pathologists on the
fine structure of alveolar cells and their
lining are fundamental.  the concepts of
alveolar stability required the special
insights of physiologists who were concerned
with the causes of bubble stability as
they related to the particular problems posed
by a lung of several millions of bubbles
arranged in parallel.  soon the contributions
of the chemists became significant as
methods of identification and assay of the al-
veolar lining material were of interest.
clinicians asked what relevance these studies
had to atelectasis as it occurs in disease,
and soon the question of when the surfac-
tant appeared in development occurred to
those concerned with premature infants.
students of metabolism began to focus on
the lung as a site of phospholipid synthesis,
and their tools seem most promising at
this time in unearthing possible errors in
metabolism which may express themselves
in disease.  surgeons who undertake per-
fusion of the isolated lung ask the
requirements of that organ with respect to the
nutrients and environment of the alveolar
cells, and anesthesiologists inquire into
the possibilities of mechanical injury
to the alveoli during artificial respiration.
the problems posed to the reviewers
of a subject which touches so many disciplines
are obvious.  doubtless some pertinent
studies have been omitted although uninten-
tionally; others may have been
misinterpreted through lack of qualifications as spe-
cialists in all specialties.  the
authors hope they have provided evidence that the
forces of surface tension cannot
be ignored in an organ with an air-liquid interface
of some 70 m2.  they further hope
they have described some of the properties of
the film at the alveolar-air interface
which operate to produce stability of the alveoli.
they hold the belief that study of the
metabolism of the alveolar lining layer will
further their understanding of a number
of disease processes in which it may be
altered.  and lastly, they hope for much
closer communication between workers in
many disciplines who can elucidate this
remarkable subject best through cooperative
studies.

1689. alterations in pulmonary surface active lipids during ex-
posure to increased oxygen tension
the syndrome of progressive respiratory
distress, pulmonary edema, and increased
pulmonary surface tension was induced in
8 dogs by exposure to oxygen tensions
greater than 550 mm hg for 44.5 and 52
hours.  pulmonary surfactant was extracted
by endobronchial washing for measurement
of lipid composition and surface activity.
five dogs developed respiratory distress
without pulmonary edema.  in these dogs
endobronchial wash surface tension was
normal or slightly increased, and total
lipid distribution was essentially normal.
esterified fatty acids in the lecithin frac-
tion were consistently altered with a
reduction in palmitate and total saturated fatty
acids.  three dogs developed pulmonary
edema with increased surface tension, in-
creased total lipid and protein, and
relatively decreased total phospholipid in the
endobronchial washings.  esterified
fatty acids in the lecithin fraction were marked-
ly altered with palmitate levels about
1/3 normal.  esterified arachidonate was pre-
sent that was attributed to intra-alveolar
plasma.  electron micrographs of the lung
after oxygen exposure showed thickening
of alveolar basement membrane and altera-
tions in the structure of the lamellar bodies
of the type ii alveolar epithelial cells.

3805. cisternal fluid oxygen tension in man
measurement of cerebral oxygen tension
in man has been hampered by technical dif-
ficulties.  the authors present a method
in which a beckman microelectrode was
introduced into the cisterna magna and
oxygen tension measured, the hypothesis
being that measurement of oxygen tension
in a fluid which equilibrates with the
average cerebral oxygen tension should
give reliable measure of cerebral oxygen
tension.  in their subjects, inhalation of
pure oxygen produced an increase in the
oxygen tension in the cisternal fluid as
well as in the arterial blood without any
alteration of the oxygen tension in the
bulb of the internal jugular vein, whereas
inhalation of 95% oxygen and 5% carbon
dioxide increased the oxygen tension in the
cisternal fluid as well as in the arterial
and venous blood.  5% carbon dioxide in
air produced an increase in the cisternal
oxygen tension; a fall in arterial blood
pressure associated with the introduction
of the suboccipital needle was accom-
panied by a decrease in cisternal oxygen
tension which then rose simultaneously with
the increase in arterial blood pressure
that followed infusion of dextran.  intravenous
injection of xanthinol niacinate induced
in all patients a more or less pronounced fall
in arterial blood pressure and at the
same time the cisternal oxygen tension fell;
administration of aramine was associated
with a rise in arterial blood pressure
plus a rise in cisternal oxygen tension.

4181. cerebrospinal fluid in man native to high altitude
csf ph was shown in a prior report to
remain essentially constant during 8 days
of acclimatization to 3,800 m.  in order
to further evaluate the possible role of
csf acid-base equilibria in the regulation
of respiration, 20 peruvian andean na-
tives were studied at altitudes of 3,720-4,820 m.
in 10 subjects at 3,720 m, means
were  csf ph 7.327, pco, 43, hco3-21.5,
na+136, k+2.6, cl-124, lactate 30 mg/
100 ml.  arterial blood  ph 7.43, pco, 32.5,
hco3-21.3, na+136, k+4.2, cl-107,
hematocrit 49, sao, 89.6.  in 6 subjects at
4,545 m and 4 at 4,820 m csf values
were not significantly different; mean arterial
pco, was 32.6 and 32.3, respectively.
the only significant variations with altitude
were the expected lowering of pao, to
47 and 43.5 mm hg, and of sao, to 84.2 and
80.7, and increase of hematocrit to
67% and 75%, respectively.  the natives
differed from recently acclimatized sea-
level residents in showing less ventilation
(higher pco,) in response to the ex-
isting hypoxia, and less alkaline arterial
blood.  the difference appears to relate
to peripheral chemoreceptor response
to hypoxia rather than central medullary
chemoreceptor.

1116. na, k, ca, mg, and cl concentrations in choroid plexus fluid
and cisternal fluid compared with plasma ultrafiltrate
in 7 cats the concentrations of na,
k, ca, mg, and cl were measured in plasma
ultrafiltrate, newly formed choroid
plexus fluid, and cisterna magna fluid.  the
choroid plexus fluid did not differ
from plasma ultrafiltrate in cl and k concentra-
tion but contained higher na, markedly
higher mg, and lower ca concentrations
than the ultrafiltrate.  cisterna magna
fluid differed from the ultrafiltrate with
respect to all 5 electrolytes, containing
higher concentrations of cl, na, and mg
and lower concentrations of k and ca.
it differed from choroid plexus fluid in con-
taining a higher concentration of cl but
lower concentrations of k, ca, and mg.
hco3-concentration, calculated on the
basis of the charge balance, was 7 mm/kg
h2o higher in choroid plexus fluid than
in cisterna magna fluid, suggesting an ele-
vated ph at the former site.  without
measurement of the potential difference be-
tween the csf and plasma, definitive
conclusions could not be drawn as to which
cations were actively transported.  the fact
that the distribution ratio between cerebro-
spinal fluid and ultrafiltrate of one divalent
cation was in the opposite direction
from that of the other, and that this was
also true of the monovalent cations, was
taken as evidence that the mechanisms
involved in cation transfer are quite selec-
tive.  though not proven, active transport
was considered the most likely explana-
tion of these findings.  the data suggest
that these specific transfer mechanisms
subserve a homeostatic function with
regard to mg and k in the cerebrospinal fluid.

3230. cerebral hemodynamics, blood gases, and electrolytes
during breath-holding and the valsalva maneuver
continuous recordings of arterial and
internal jugular blood oxygen tension, oxy-
gen saturation, carbon dioxide tension,
ph, sodium and potassium, together with
peco2, blood pressure, and
electroencephalogram were obtained to compare the
effects of inspiratory and expiratory
breath-holding and the valsalva maneuver on
the cerebral circulation and cerebral
oxygen availability in man.  during the inter-
val of tolerated breath-holding for
69 seconds or less, jugular venous oxygen tension
was increased owing to increased
cerebral blood flow resulting from an increase
of arterial carbon dioxide tension.
there was a statistically significant correlation
between changes in jpo2 and paco2,
which proved to be more or less linear for
both increases and decreases of paco2 4 mm.
above and below control levels.  no
threshold was found for changes in paco2
altering effective cerebral perfusion and
cerebral venous po2, extremely small
changes in paco2 (less than 1 mm. hg)
altered cerebral oxygen availability within
10 to 20 seconds.  during the valsalva
maneuver a consistent reduction of jugular
oxygen tension was found associated
with the sudden fall in arterial blood
pressure and reduction of arterial carbon
dioxide tension.  the rapid changes in
cerebral hemodynamics and cerebral oxy-
gen availability during the procedure
are briefly discussed.

2344. respiratory and cardiovascular changes during rapid spon-
taneous variations of ventricular fluid pressure in pa-
tients with intracranial hypertension
in patients with intracranial hypertension
the ventricular fluid pressure (vfp)
curve is characterized by 3 main forms
of spontaneous variations.  two of these
forms are of a rhythmical nature, and
are here called 1-per-minute waves and 6-
per-minute waves, respectively, in
accordance with the dominating frequency.
the third form - irregularly appearing
waves of large amplitude and duration -
is called plateau waves in accordance
with the usual shape of the fluctuations.
respiratory and cardio-vascular changes
accompanying these variations of the vfp
were studied by simultaneous recording,
in various combinations, of the vfp, the
pulmonary ventilation, the pco2 of the
expiratory air, the arterial and the venous
blood pressure, and the pulse frequency.
it was found that the rhythmic vfp vari-
ations of the 1-per-minute type occurred
synchronously with the respiratory peri-
ods in cheyne-stokes breathing.
synchronously appearing variations in systemic
blood pressure, in pulse frequency,
as well as in consciousness and in muscular
tone of the limbs were also noted.  the
respiratory midposition shifted towards the
inspiratory side during the periods of
hyperpnoea.  the 6-per-minute waves were
entirely synchronous with variations
in the systemic arterial blood pressure of the
traube-hering-mayer type.  long
sequences of these waves were observed only
when the vfp level was considerably
elevated.  the plateau waves were not accom-
panied by corresponding elevations of
the arterial or venous systemic blood pres-
sure.  simultaneously with the crests
of the plateau waves sudden changes often
occurred in the pulse frequency (from
bradycardia to tachycardia), and in the res-
piratory pattern, sometimes also in the
degree of consciousness and in the muscu-
lar tone.  there were also long sequences
of 6-per-minute waves.  the deep, irre-
gular breathing seen in this stage induced
a considerable hypocapnia preceeding
the final critical fall in the vfp ending the
plateau wave.  in most instances, how-
ever, this fall did not begin until several
minutes after the appearance of the hypo-
capnia.

82. central nervous system lesions in rats
exposed to oxygen at high pressure
adult female rats paralyzed by repeated exposures
to oxygen at high pressure were found to have cns le-
sions of 2 types  (1) focal necrosis of individual neurons
within certain nuclear groups, and (2) complete or partial
necrosis of nuclear groups with frequent damage to mye-
lin, axons, and glia in the area involved.  both types
were usually bilateral and symmetrical.  lesions of the
first type were found consistently in the superior olivary
complex, ventral cochlear nuclei, and nuclei of the spinal
tract of cranial nerve v.  lesions of the second type were
found consistently in the substantia nigra and globus pal-
lidus, were frequent in the rhinencephalon, and never
occurred in the neocortex.

747. electrode size and tissue po2 measurement in rats exposed
to air or high pressure oxygen
a comparison has been made of values of
po2 recorded in several rat tissues with
60-u or 330-u flexible gold electrodes.
although qualitatively both sizes of elec-
trodes give similar results, the quantitative
values of po2 differ.  such large differ-
ences as are found in some cases between
electrodes varying only in physical di-
mensions are thought to reflect the amount
of trauma caused in the tissue under in-
vestigation due to electrode insertion.
errors in po2 estimations due to tissue da-
mage are considered to outweigh any other
errors such as those due to electrode
calibration.  soft, highly vascular tissues,
such as liver, kidney and spleen, which
show macroscopic bruising over quite a
large area when electrodes are inserted,
show the greatest difference in estimations
of the po2 value.  recordings of tissue
po2 were made while animals breathed air
and when compressed to 4 or 5 atm. in
pure oxygen, and the pattern of response of
tissue po2 to such exposure of the ani-
mal to high pressures of oxygen is described.

3384. adrenergic effects in splenic po2 of rats in air or oxygen
at 5 atmospheres
oxygen tensions have been measured
in the spleens of rats breathing air and during
exposure of the animals to 5 atm abs
of oxygen (hpo).  the response of splenic po2
to compression was complex, usually
reaching a peak value immediately after com-
pression, then falling to a lower value.
this form of response has been termed a
hump response.  after adrenalectomy
or bretylium tosylate injection the hump res-
ponse of po2 after compression was
almost abolished, and the values of splenic po2
at 5 atm were considerably higher
than in control animals.  a combination of adrena-
lectomy and bretylium tosylate also
markedly reduced the number of hump responses,
but unexpectedly significantly lowered
splenic oxygen tensions, both when the ani-
mals were under ambient conditions
or at 5 atm of oxygen.  cardiac rate and blood
pressure were studied in an attempt
to find the explanation of this latter effect, and
while blood pressure was the same
in adrenalectomized rats and control rats after
bretylium injection, adrenalectomy
potentiated the bradycardia produced by brety-
lium tosylate.

10642. the effects of antioxidants on high pressure oxygen toxicity
several commonly used antioxidants have
been tested for their effect against poison-
ing due to high pressures of oxygen (ohp).
the tests used were preconclusive pe-
riod and survival time of mice at 5 atm
absolute oxygen, lung damage in rats ex-
posed to 5 atm oxygen for 1 hr., and post
ohp paralysis in rats following deep
pentobarbital-na anesthesia and ohp at 4
atm for 30 min.  2,5-bis (1,1-dimethyl-
propyl) hydroquinone gave excellent
protection against ohp toxicity in all tests,
and several other antioxidants also
protected against ohp toxicity but their potency
and effectiveness varied for the
different criteria of oxygen poisoning tested in the
experiments.

3716. glycolytic control mechanisms. i. inhibition of glycolysis
by acetate and pyruvate in the isolated, perfused rat heart
acetate or pyruvate had similar effects
on the over-all metabolism of glucose.  gly-
colytic flux was decreased in both the
presence and absence of insulin, glucose
oxidation was greatly decreased, and
the conversion of glucose to glycogen and lac-
tate was promoted.  glucose phosphorylation
was decreased in the presence but not
in the absence of insulin.  hexokinase,
phosphofructokinase, glyceraldehyde phos-
phate dehydrogenase, and pyruvic kinase
are far displaced from equilibrium, while
the other enzymic steps of glycolysis
are maintained either at equilibrium or fairly
close to equilibrium.  in different metabolic
situations, glycolytic flux may be affec-
ted by those steps which are far displaced
from equilibrium.  increased levels of
the hexose monophosphates, and decreased
levels of the other glycolytic inter-
mediates between fructose 1,6-diphosphate
and pyruvate after the addition of 10 mm
acetate indicate that glycolytic flux was
decreased by inhibition of phosphofructo-
kinase.  after the addition of 10 mm pyruvate,
fructose 1,6-diphosphate, and triose-
phosphate accumulated as a result of an
inhibition of either glyceraldehyde phosphate
dehydrogenase or phosphoglyceric kinase.
acetate had little effect on the total con-
tent of oxidized or reduced di- or
triphosphopyridine nucleotides, but slightly de-
creased the ratio of nad to nadh2
in the cytoplasm, as estimated from the ratios
of lactate to pyruvate and a-glycerophosphate
to dihydroxyacetone phosphate.  pyru-
vate increased the total content of nadh2
and nadph2 as shown both by an increase
of fluorescence in the intact heart, and by
tissue analyses, but the ratio of nad to
nadii2 in the cytoplasm was greatly
increased.  these results demonstrate com-
partmentation of pyridine nucleotides
between cytoplasm and mitochondria in the
intact cell.  after the addition of acetate,
citrate was the only intermediate of the
citric acid cycle which increased greatly
in amount, while oxaloacetate levels de-
creased.  after the addition of pyruvate,
the levels of citrate, a-ketoglutarate, ma-
late, and oxaloacetate were all greatly
elevated.  the glutamic-oxaloacetate trans-
aminase reaction as measured from the
total contents of the reactants in the tissue
remained close to equilibrium.  changes
in the concentrations of the adenine nu-
cleotides were insufficient to account for
the inhibition of phosphofructokinase, but
the results are consistent with control at this
step being mediated by citrate.

244. oxygen tension in human malignant disease under hyperbaric
conditions
oxygen tensions were recorded continuously
in tumours and normal tissues of 34 pa-
tients pressurized in pure oxygen to 4 atmospheres
absolute.  mean rises to 620 mm.
hg and 320 mm. hg for tumours and normal tissues
respectively were recorded.
with patients breathing air at atmospheric
pressure 22/90 (24%) of tumour elec-
trodes registered po2values of less than 4 mm. hg
compared to only 2/39 (5%) of normal
tissue electrodes.  the results obtained
suggest that oxygen polarography as a meth-
od for determining po2 in 'solid' tissues
in vivo is complicated by many artefacts -
particularly tissue damage due to electrode
trauma - which reduce its value to clin-
ical research concerned with accurate
information of absolute po2 values in intact
tissues.

7839.cortical ph and the blood-brain barrier
a method was described for measuring
the ph, dc and ac potentials concurrently
on the cerebral cortex of the adult cat,
under conditions of controlled ventilation.
kittens and rabbits were also studied.
the cortical ph response to i.v. nahco3
was acidic and was accompanied by a
dc negativity, while the blood became alkaline.
such an acidic response was present in
the rabbit and kitten.  it was not present
in a number of other tissues in the cat,
including the dura.  the cortical acidic
response was not affected, qualitatively,
by i.v. acetazolamide, prolonged hypoxia
or 10% (v/v) co2.  it was reduced reversibly
by 20% (v/v) co2.  it was not affected
by removal of the arachnoid membrane.
the cortical ph response to an i.v. nh4+
salt solution was complex.  nh4c1 did not
produce an alkaline response.  the cortical
ph response to an alkaline or an acidic
sodium phosphate solution was augmented
but not changed in its direction following
treatment of the cortex with n-butanol.
the results were interpreted in terms of
a restriction of hco3- by the blood-brain
barrier, through which co2 can pass.  this
restriction is probably non-specific for
inorganic ions, and perhaps for other
substances.  it does not appear to be related
to a low cerebral extracellular space,
and is independent of substantial oxidative metabolism.

7083. brain damage and paralysis in animals exposed to high pressure oxygen -
pharmacological and biochemical observations
single exposures of high pressure oxygen
(ohp) at 30-66  gauge pressure caused
cns damage and paralysis in rats and mice
but guinea-pigs, rabbits, and man did
not show such sequelae.  the cns damage
in rats was greatly increased by cns-de-
pressant drugs (pentobarbital, paraldehyde,
n2o and phencyclidine) given before ex-
posure to ohp.  the cns lesions were also
potentiated by raised respired pco2, by
acetazolamide and by nh4c1, whilst protection
was afforded by methaemoglobinae-
mia by tham, by 2 4-dinitrophenol and by
serotonin against the barbiturate and
co2 potentiation of ohp brain damage.
ohp-induced brain damage was not modified
by hypothermia (cp2), electroconvulsive
shock treatment during ohp, cerebral x-
irradiation, adrenalectomy or cortisone,
slow decompression rates, spinal block
with local anaesthetic, 'conditioning' of
rats to ohp, hyper- and hypoglycaemia, or
alterations in tissue histamine levels.
the results are discussed in relation to pos-
sible biochemical mechanisms and
theories of oxygen poisoning.

8914. the effect of hypoxia on oxygen consumption of cerebral
cortex, liver slices and of diaphragm in vitro during post-
natal development of the rat
oxygen consumption of slices from the liver
and cerebral cortex and of the cut dia-
phragm was determined in rats aged 5, 10,
14, 20 and 25 days and in adult animals.
under hypoxic conditions (gas phase 10%
oxygen, 90% nitrogen) oxygen consumption
of liver slices and diaghragm is decreased
by about 25% in all age groups.  hypoxia,
however, did not affect oxygen consumption
of slices of the cortex from 5-day-old
rats and its inhibitory effect only appeared
later as the normal oxygen consumption
started to rise.  the inhibitory effect of
hypoxia was greatest in adult animals.

5407. hypoxic-hypercapnic interaction in subjects with bilateral
cerebral dysfunction
to analyze cerebral influences modifying
autonomic respiratory responses, the
authors compared normals and patients
with bilateral pyramidal tract disease for
their ventilatory response to hypoxia and
hypoxia-hypercapnia.  during eucapnia,
the 2 groups showed similar hypoxic
responses.  during hypercapnia, the ventilatory
response to hypoxia was greater in the
brain-damaged subjects.  this apparent aug-
mentation, however, was due entirely
to anoxia interacting with an abnormally fa-
cilitated carbon dioxide sensitivity
compared with normals, brain-damaged patients
at pao,90-100 mm hg showed an 85%
greater co2 response, and at pao,50mm hg
showed a 79% greater co2 response.
since cerebral dysfunction facilitated the ven-
tilatory response to hypoxia-hypercapnia
combined but not the response to hypoxia
alone, the results imply that the 2
respiratory stimuli interact centrally rather than
peripherally.

3917. plasma free fatty acid and blood sugar levels in newborn
infants and their mothers
simultaneous plasma free fatty acid (ffa)
and blood sugar levels were determined
for fasting newborn infants during the first
24 hours of life, for their cord bloods,
and for their mothers at delivery.  the
following observations were made.  in con-
trol infants the mean ffa level rose about
three times the cord level after birth
and was accompanied by a 25% drop in the
mean blood sugar level.  thereafter, the
mean blood sugar level remained relatively
constant, but the mean ffa level varied
from 2.5 to 3 times the cord level.  there
was no significant correlation between the
length of maternal fasting prior to delivery
and the infant ffa level; there was,
however, a significant negative correlation
between the length of maternal fasting
prior to delivery and the infant blood sugar
level at 24 hours of age.  high ffa levels
occurred in the infants of obese mothers
and low levels were observed in infants with
delayed respirations, in infants of preeclamptic
mothers, and in infants of diabetic
mothers.

2933. the essential fatty acid requirement of infants and the
assessment of their dietary intake of linoleate by serum
fatty acid analysis
the content of polyunsaturated fatty acids
in serum total fatty acids was related
to the dietary intake of linoleate in 243 infants
two to four months of age and in 197
infants eleven to twelve months of age.  the
curves relating triene tetraene ratio
to dietary linoleate indicated approximately
1 per cent of total calories as minimal
linoleate requirement.  the exponential
equations relating dienoic, trienoic and
tetraenoic acids to dietary linoleate were
derived by computer methods.  these
yielded constants from which the minimal
nutrient requirement could be calculated.
the best estimates were obtained from the
triene and tetraene data for two to four
months' old infants and were found to be
approximately 1.4 per cent of the caloric
intake.  the nutritive status with respect to
linoleate may be estimated by means
of logarithmic regression equations.  the
equation for two to four months' old infants
is  log 10 dietary linoleate = -1.087 + 0.0432
(di - tri + tetra).  the data for eleven to
twelve months' old infants were found to have
greater scatter and give lower triene
tetraene ratios at comparable linoleate intakes.
the scatter and displacement are
considered to be due to supplements of solid food
to the basic diet not considered in
the calculated dietary linoleate.

74. analytic study of the a- and b-lipoprotein micellar groups
and of nonesterified fatty acids of the plasma in normal pregnancy
an analytical study has been made on 39
patients, using a chemical method which
allows the simultaneous detailed evaluation
of the lipidic and a- and b-liproproteinic
fractions of the plasma.  in addition the
non-esterified fatty acids have been titrated,
the b-proteins and the uric acid assayed,
and numerous indices and deducible ratios
made from the data obtained.  the existence
of quantitative dyslipidemia has been
proven, starting gradually, especially in the
4th-5th month of pregnancy, and most-
ly regarding the b-lipoproteins, prevalently
the slow subfractions, greater increase
of glycerides than phosphatides and cholesterol,
but with a non-proportional in-
crease of b-proteins (lower proteinic content).
it has, moreover, been noted that
there is a prevalent rise of free cholesterol in
the fraction of b-lipoproteins with
a reduction of the total esterification coefficient.
the morphological picture of the
lipidic rate in pregnancy shows characteristics
which, according to the authors,
are like those to be seen in the lipidic rate of
male presenility.

before labour there are in the blood 75-95
mg.% of p.f.a., i.e. 10-15% more
than in non-pregnant women; during labour
p.f.a. increase very much, 100-137

5196. effects of nutritional deficiency of unsaturated fats on
the distribution of fatty acids in rat liver mitochondrial phospholipids
the fatty acid composition of liver mitochondrial
phospholipids from rats rendered
deficient in essential unsaturated fatty acids
has been determined, and compared
with that of rats fed a diet containing corn oil.
in addition to marked reductions in
the amounts of linoleic and arachidonic acids
esterified at the b-position of ethanol-
amine-, inositol-, and choline glycerophosphatides,
the deficiency resulted in ex-
tensive changes in the distribution of saturated
acids at both the a- and b-positions.
palmitoleic and oleic acids were increased in
amount in fat deficiency, and large
amounts of docosatrienoic acids appeared in
these 3 phospholipids.  the fatty acids
of the sphingomyelins were not altered as a
result of essential fatty acid deficiency.
the data demonstrate that each phospholipid
is unique in the way in which its fatty
acid moieties change in response to feeding
a fat deficient diet.

3204. interventricular septal defects with aortic insufficiency
sanchez f.-villaran e.
the coincidence of these 2 malformations
permits their diagnosis provided that a
careful evaluation is made of the hemodynamic
and oximetric data, on the basis of
specific auscultatory features.  even then, a
differentiation from other cardiopathies
patent ductus arteriosus with/without pulmonary
hypertension, aortopulmonary sep-
tal defect, interventricular communication,
truncus arteriosus, aneurysm of the
sinus aortae ruptured into right cavities - is
not simple.  for this an analysis of the
course of the syndrome together with the
information supplied by phonocardiography,
catheterization, angiocardiography, radiology
and ecg (in this order of importance)
are indispensable.  an analysis is made of 5 cases
in which, in the absence of ana-
tomical confirmation, concrete data were obtained
on which to base the diagnosis.

2579. measurement of aortic regurgitation by upstream sampling with continuous
infusion of indicator
a direct and theoretically valid method
for the measurement of aortic regurgitation
involves the recording of indicator concentrations
from the left ventricle and a down-
stream site during aortic root injection.  however,
this method has yielded erratic
results when applied to man in the authors'
laboratory when using the sudden in-
jection technique.  therefore, the upstream
sampling method, using continuous in-
fusion of indicator, was evaluated in 18 patients
with aortic regurgitation during
retrograde aortic and transseptal left ventricular
catheterization.  the continuous
infusion technique was compared with the technique
of sudden injection in 10 patients
and with aortic valvulography in 14 patients.
measurements of forward flow obtained
with continuous infusions into the aortic root
were not significantly different from
measurements obtained with sudden injections
into the pulmonary artery.  recordings
of indicator concentrations from the left ventricle,
during continuous infusions into
the aortic root, demonstrated readily evident
equilibrium plateaus.  the resultant
measurements of regurgitant flow were highly
reproducible and not impaired by
nonsimultaneity of upstream and downstream
sampling.  the percentage error of
estimate at 95% confidence limits was 22% of
the measurement for regurgitant flow,
13% for total flow, and 9% for the regurgitant
fraction of total flow.  the correspond-
ing errors of estimate for the sudden injection
technique were 4 times larger.  re-
gurgitant flow by the continuous infusion method
ranged from 0.8-30.0 l/min, total
flow from 3.0-36.0 l/min, and the regurgitant
fraction of total flow from 12-86%.
ranking of patients by the magnitudes of regurgitant
and total flow did not correspond
to ranking by angiographic criteria of severity.
however, an excellent correlation
prevailed between angiographic grade and the regurgitant
fraction of total flow,
demonstrating that this variable is the most meaningful
expression of severity.  the
correlation (0.997) between the angiographic grade and
the regurgitant fraction
measured by the continuous infusion technique was
clearly superior to that obtained
with the sudden injection technique (0.894).  mild
regurgitation was equivalent to
a regurgitant fraction of <25%, moderate
regurgitation to a fraction of 25-50%,
moderately severe regurgitation to a fraction
of 50-75% and severe regurgitation to
a fraction of >75%.  it is concluded that the
upstream sampling method during con-
tinuous infusion of indicator, because of its
sensitivity, reliability, applicability to
multiple measurements, and validity in the
presence of mitral regurgitation is the
most useful method for quantifying aortic
regurgitation in man.

2950. aortico-left ventricular tunnel.  a cause of massive aortic regurgitation
and of intracardiac aneurysm
the clinical, roentgenographic, hemodynamic
and pathologic findings in a 14-year-
old boy with aortico-left ventricular tunnel are
presented.  the accessory channel
between the aorta and left ventricle resulted in
massive aortic regurgitation, and
the portion of the tunnel which traversed the
ventricular septum was aneurysmal,
displaced the posterior wall of the right
ventricle and caused severe obstruction
to right ventricular outflow.  the presence
of associated cardiovascular anomalies,
in this and previously reported cases,
suggests that the malformation is congenital
rather than acquired.  the clinical and
hemodynamic manifestations of aortico-left
ventricular tunnel are indistinguishable
from those observed with the more common
forms of aortic regurgitation, and the
correct diagnosis can be established only by
thoracic aortography.  the malformation
is usually recognized in childhood; since
aortic regurgitant flow can be abolished by
simple closure of the aortic ostium,
and without aortic valve replacement, the
indications for operative treatment
differ from those which apply in aortic
regurgitation due to a valvular anomaly.

502. the haemodynamic implications of the bisferiens pulse
a bisferiens carotid arterial displacement pulse
was recorded in 10 patients with
severe aortic valvular disease.  the braunwald
test indicated that moderately severe,
severe, or gross aortic regurgitation was present
in each.  the absence of a peak
systolic aortic pressure gradient in certain cases,
particularly in those with the
most severe regurgitation, suggested their freedom
from an element of stenosis.
the anacrotic wave and the peak of the aortic
pressure pulse were found to coincide
with the percussion and the tidal waves of the
simultaneously recorded carotid ar-
terial displacement curves.  it is suggested that
amplitude of the peak of the anacro-
tic wave is proportional to the rate of change of
momentum of the ejected blood, and
that the amplitude of the corresponding percussion
wave of displacement is modified by
the distensibility of the artery.  the depth and shape
of the trough between the two
peaks is thought to depend upon the magnitude and
slope of the two waves rather than
upon a venturi effect.  it is suggested that the condition
of the arterial wall, the dia-
stolic blood pressure, and the stroke volume can
influence the pulse sufficiently to
preclude its use as a simple guide to the nature of
the aortic valve lesion.

2753. left ventricular function following replacement of the
aortic valve.  hemodynamic responses to muscular exercise
evaluations of left ventricular myocardial
function were carried out in 14 patients
4-16 mth after stenotic or regurgitant
malformations of the aortic valve had been
corrected by valve replacement.  the
circulatory responses to exercise, judged by
the increases in cardiac output in relation
to the increases in oxygen consumption,
were normal or only mildly reduced in 12
patients.  in 5 patients the relationships
between the change in the left ventricular
end-diastolic pressure and the alteration
in the stroke volume were also normal, a
fall or an increase in left ventricular
end-diastolic pressure of less than 3 mm
hg being accompanied by an increase in
stroke volume.  in 8 patients, however,
abnormal increases in the left ventricular
end-diastolic pressure occurred during
exercise, and in 4 the left ventricular end-
diastolic pressure was increased to levels
above 12 mm hg.  variable alterations in
the stroke volume accompanied these increases
in end-diastolic pressure.  it is
suggested that in the 3 patients who exhibited
simultaneous increases in left ven-
tricular end-diastolic pressure and stroke
volume, the changes were either a mani-
festation of the frank-starling mechanism,
or primarily the result of a positive
inotropic influence.  in the 5 patients who
exhibited increases in left ventricular
end-diastolic pressure, but no change or a
fall in stroke volume, it is proposed
that a distinct depression of left ventricular
performance was present.  thus, while
the cardiac output response was adequate to
meet the stress of exercise in the
majority of the patients studied following aortic
valve replacement, determination
of the relationship between the left ventricular
end-diastolic pressure and the stroke
volume permitted the detection of abnormalities
in the function of the left ventricle.

2497. pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum
when the pulmonary valve is atretic and
the ventricular septum intact, the right
ventricle usually consists of a small chamber
with a very thick wall capable of de-
veloping high pressure.  this pathologic picture
is associated with clinical findings
similar to those in tricuspid atresia-cyanosis,
decreased pulmonary flow, left ven-
tricular preponderance on the electrocardiogram,
and early death.  the diagnosis
may be confirmed by heart catheterization and
selective angiocardiography with in-
jection into the right ventricle, but the risk is
great.  surgery has never been suc-
cessful in the past; but because of the equally
hopeless prognosis on medical treat-
ment, attempts should continue to be made.
anastomosis of the superior vena cava
to the right pulmonary artery appears to offer
hope of success in the future.

1635. intra-atrial pressure measurement and electrocardiography in the
detailed diagnosis of atrial septal defect
after discussing the possibilities and
limitations of different methods for identifying
the anatomical type of atrial septal
defect, the authors suggest a more useful new
method.  this consists in simultaneous
recording of both the pressure curve and
endocavitary electrocardiogram during
withdrawal of the catheter from the left into
the right atrium.  in the ostium primum
type, the septal foramen has no infe-
rior margin, and the point of the catheter
during retraction (unlike in the ostium
secundum type) rests on the intermediate
section of the atrioventricular septum.
the endocavitary electrocardiogram in the
zone of passage between the two atria
shows the typical pattern of the intermediate
section of the atrioventricular septum;
the pressure curve may show a pattern of the
atrial of intravalvular type.

two cases of ventriuclar cuptal aneurysm
are reported, one in the membranous and one
in the muscular portion.  the diagnosis was
made by selective left ventricular angiogra-
phy.  it is suggested that these cases represent
spontaneous closure of a ventricular septal
defect with weakness and aneurysmal formation
due to the high left ventricular pressure.
both are asymptomatic and hemodynamically
within normal limits.  surgical repair
of the aneurysms is not considered necessary.

1642. electrode catheters and the diagnosis of ebstein's anomaly
of the tricuspid valve
the successful surgical treatment of ebstein's
anomaly calls for accurate pre-ope-
rative assessment of the nature and severity of
the tricuspid valvular lesion.  the
increased risk of cardiac catheterization in this
condition has been matched by in-
creased experience of intracardiac techniques,
and provided the examination is in
skilled hands, patients with ebstein's anomaly
should be investigated in the same
way as those with any other serious congenital
heart lesion for whom surgery is con-
templated.  the diagnostic value of electrode
catheters is discussed, and the intra-
cardiac electrocardiographic features of ebstein's
anomaly are illustrated.  false
positive and false negative records are demonstrated
and the mechanism of their
production is explained.  it is concluded that, though
helpful, intracardiac electro-
cardiographic evidence should be regarded as confirmatory
rather than diagnostic.
records made with electrode catheters during cardiac
catheterization should be con-
sidered only along with the other clinical,
electrocardiographic, and radiological
features of the case, and should not be relied upon
as the definitive method in the
diagnosis of ebstein's anomaly.

ing into the arterial atrium and
passage of venous blood
into the aorta through a ventricular

1991. ventricular septal defect with aortic regurgitation.
medical and pathologic aspects
thirty-four patients with ventricular septal defect
and aortic regurgitation, repre-
senting less than 5% of the patients with ventricular
septal defect, are discussed.
a loud, systolic murmur, characteristic of ventricular
septal defect, is noted dur-
ing infancy, whereas evidences of aortic regurgitation
(protodiastolic murmur and
wide pulse pressure) does not usually appear until some
time between 2 and 10
years of age.  clinical and catheterization data indicate
that the principal hemody-
namic load is aortic regurgitation, whereas the
ventricular septal defect does not
usually result in a large pulmonary blood flow or
high pulmonary arterial pressure.
in about 50% of the patients, a significant pressure
gradient across the right ven-
tricular outflow tract exists.  detailed pathologic
studies indicate that the ventricular
septal defects are high and anterior and encroach
to a greater or lesser degree on
the membranous bulbar septum.  the right coronary
cusp is the one most severely
involved, and, by its prolapse, causes aortic
regurgitation; the noncoronary cusp
is always less severely affected.  the anatomic basis
of the pressure gradient ob-
served across the right ventricular outflow tract is
not always clear.

2431. the natural history of arrhythmias following septal defect reapir
the repair of 191 atrial and ventricular septal
defects between 1955 and 1961 was
reviewed to determine the incidence and prognosis
of arrhythmias related to operation.
cases included 90 ventricular septal defects, 61
atrial defects of the ostium secundum
type, and 40 of the ostium primum variety.
nodal rhythms, second degree blocks,
complete heart block, and flutter or fibrillation that
persisted after completion of operation
were analyzed, while intermittent ectopic beats,
sinus tachycardia, and bundle branch
blocks were excluded.  fifteen per cent of the
patients with ventricular defects, 17%
with ostium primum defects, and 35% with ostium
secundum defects developed abnormal
rhythms associated with repair.  of 18 patients whose
arrhythmias began during operation,
there were 8 deaths; no fatalities occurred in the 24
patients who developed arrhythmias
in the postoperative period.  seven deaths were
associated with complete heart block and
one with second degree block.  although only one
half of the patients who developed
arrhythmias had pulmonary artery pressure greater
than 30 mm. hg systolic, all fatalities
occurred in this group.  four of the deaths followed
surgery with the use of the pump
oxygenator in children under 30 months of age.
thirty-eight per cent of the abnormal
rhythms that began in the postoperative period
were nodal.  flutter and fibrillation
were common following repair of atrial secundum
defects in patients over 15 yr. of age
but did not occur in younger patients.  deaths from
heart block occurred in the first 30 days
following operation except one, 5 months later.
survivors of complete heart block reverted
to a less serious arrhythmia or normal rhythm
within 3 months.

1021. left ventricular angiocardiography in the study of ventricular
septal defects
sixty-five cases of ventricular septal defect
were studied by left angiocardiography.
the left ventricle was entered by retrograde
arterial catheterization with a catheter
having a j-shaped tip.  this procedure appears
to be little, or no more, hazardous
than right-sided angiocardiography.  ventricular
septal defects may be divided into
5 types, depending on their location in the ventricular
septum.  the anatomic and
radiological features of the septum and septal defects
are described.  selective in-
jection of contrast material into the left ventricle
opacifies the blood passing through
the defect in the septum and permits preoperative
localization of the defect in rela-
tion to identifiable anatomic landmarks.  multiple
defects of the septum are well de-
monstrated.  such information may be of
considerable value to the surgeon under-
taking repair of the septum.  left ventriculography,
often combined with supraval-
vular aortography, has been used, when indicated,
to differentiate between mitral
insufficiency and ventricular septal defect and in
the detection of other cardiac ano-
malies whose manifestations are marked by those
of the septal lesion.  this tech-
nique is well suited to the postoperative study of
patients following repair of the
septal defect and for follow-up studies in patients
not operated upon to clarify the
natural history of defects in different portions of
the ventricular septum.

4105. free fatty acid metabolism in chinese hamsters
in normal chinese hamsters (cricetulus
griseus) the mean concentration of free
fatty acids (ffa) in serum varied from
group to group, but was (1) consistently 4
to 9 times greater than in rats, dogs,
or man; (2) slightly higher than in syrian
hamsters; (3) two- to four-fold higher
than in fasting or alloxan-diabetic rats.  the
epididymal adipose tissue of the chinese
hamster (1) had initial concentrations of
ffa comparable to those in the rat and
syrian hamster; (2) released, in the same
time interval, 8- to 10-fold more ffa
in vitro than this tissue of the rat; (3) had
higher concentrations of ffa after incubation
than the incubated tissue of the rat.
the retroperitoneal (perirenal) adipose tissue
of the chinese hamster was less ac-
tive in release of fatty acids in vitro than the
epididymal, but was, however, more
active than the epididymal adipose tissue of
the rat.  these characteristics of ffa
metabolism in the chinese hamster were
apparently attributable to species, not to
age, diet, or sex.  in the chinese hamster,
the weight of the epididymal adipose tis-
sue per gram of body was relatively high.
it appears that in this species the rate of
release of fatty acids from adipose tissue
is great, leading to high ffa concentra-
tions in serum.  in chinese hamster and rat
adipose tissues in vitro, glucose and in-
sulin (separately) reduced the rate of release
of ffa and the amount of ffa in the
tissues, but glucose and insulin together
produced the greatest reduction.  the net
reduction in ffa release by glucose and
insulin in vitro was greater in tissue from
the chinese hamster.  insulin markedly
increased glucose uptake by the adipose tis-
sues of both species.  the possible relation
of the results to spontaneous diabetes in
the chinese hamster is discussed.

95. changes in serum non-esterified fatty acid levels in spon-
taneous and in oxytocin induced labour
the nonesterified fatty acid (nefa)
concentration of serum rises progressively
during the course of normal labor.
the rise appears to be related to the duration
of labor.  the use of oxytocin to induce
and stimulate labor does not alter the normal
pattern of rise in nefa provided it is
given in physiologic dosage.  the levels of
nefa in the umbilical vein and the
umbilical artery at delivery are comparable and
always significantly lower than the
maternal level.  the maternal/fetal ratio varies
between 1.7 1 and 3.9 1 in this series.
following delivery the nefa levels begin
to fall almost immediately.  the rate
of fall is 10-30% of the delivery value in the 1st
hour, 30-50% within 18 hr. and 50-70% within 36 hr.

1545. the effect of combined glucose and insulin infusions on
the lipoid and carbohydrate metabolism of the parturient
woman and of the fetus
the infusion of glucose with insulin during delivery
was used by the authors pri-
marily in order to determine, whether the utilization
of glucose can be enhanced
under these conditions.  they wanted to investigate,
whether the increase of unesteri-
fied fatty acids in the cord blood which takes place
after a sole glucose infusion in
the mother, could be caused by the low capability
of glucose utilization in the fetus.
the infusion during delivery which consisted of the
application of 500 ml of 10%
glucose and 16 u of insulin over a period of 30 min.
brought about a greater decrease
of unesterified fatty acids in the parturient woman
as compared with the infusion of
glucose exclusively.  the reason for this result
is thought to be due to a better utili-
zation of glucose which is favorably influenced
by insulin.  during the infusion of
glucose with insulin, an increase in the values
of lactic and pyruvic acid took place
in the parturient women; this was probably due
to an accelerated glycolysis and an
increased production of lactic acid, but not
caused by a higher share of the anaerobic
metabolism.  in the cord blood, there were
likewise increased values of lactic and py-
ruvic acid as a reflection of the higher values
of these substances in the mother.  the
formation of these products of metabolic
breakdown by the fetus, however, was not
significantly increased.  after infusion of
glucose with insulin, the other investigated
parameter values, including those of the levels
of unesterified fatty acids are found
in the cord blood in similar amounts as after
infusion of glucose alone.  these re-
sults cannot reliably prove the passage of
insulin through the placenta especially
after a continued study of the metabolic values
in newborns.  as a proof of the passage
of insulin through the placenta could not be
established, it is possible that after an
intake of insulin the increase of unesterified
fatty acids in the cord blood could be
caused by a relative insufficiency of the insular
apparatus of the fetus.  the most
probable reason for the increase of unesterified
fatty acids is the different depo-
sition and metabolization of unesterified fatty
acids in the course of intrauterine
life.

1547. glucose and nonesterified fatty acid levels in maternal
and cord plasma
the authors established in 44 healthy women

of the mother and of the umbilical cord.
the concentration of both substances was
significantly higher in the mother than in
the infant.  the relation for free fatty acids
was 1.7 1, that for glucose 1.3 1.  the
relation glucose fatty acids in the mother was
significantly different from that in the
infant.

3294. epinephrine infusions in normal and toxemic pregnancies.
ii. plasma glucose, nonesterified fatty acid, and epineph-
rine-norepinephrine alterations
seven controls and 9 preeclamptic patients
were infused with different amounts of
epinephrine.  plasma nefa, glucose and
catecholamines were determined before,
during and after epinephrine infusion.  the
toxemic patient responds to the metabolic
effects of infused epinephrine in a manner
similar to that of the normal pregnant
patient.  the increased levels of nefa in
pregnant patients are explained by a com-
plicated biochemical mechanism involving
an increased availability of cortisone-like
steroids, slightly increased amounts of thyroid,
hormones, etc., resulting in an
alteration of carbohydrate utilization.  the study
leads to the conclusion that epi-
nephrine is not an etiologic agent in toxemia of pregnancy.

766. a lipid-mobilizing substance in the serum of pregnant wo-
men, of probable placental origin
a substance capable of inducing free fatty
acid (ffa) release was found in the sera
of 12 from 13 pregnant women.  the rat
epididymal fat pad was used for bioassay.
this substance circulates in late pregnancy
and disappears within 5 days post partum.
it is present in crude placental extracts and
is removed by their deproteination.  it
is nondialyzable.  application of pituitary
extraction procedure to placentae yielded
active fractions where pituitary growth
hormone is usually found.  in accordance with
these facts a hypothesis concerning a part
of metabolic changes occurring during preg-
nancy was pronounced as follows.  the
described substance diminishes maternal glu-
cose consumption through the elevation of
plasma free fatty acids, or by direct in-
hibition of glucose uptake, or both.  this
permits a preferential shunting of glucose
to the fetus.  at the same time, increased
plasma free fatty acid levels would serve
as the alternative maternal energy substrate.
elevated maternal insulin levels during
late pregnancy stabilize the degree of maternal
lipid mobilization.  the contrainsulin
properties of a substance capable of mobilizing
free fatty acids and inhibiting mater-
nal glucose utilization would pose a diabetogenic
challenge, and in the face of com-
promised maternal insulin reserves, provoke
overt or worsen existing diabetes
mellitus.

3682. metabolism of free fatty acids during perinatal life of lambs
there is a rapid rise of free fatty acids
in blood plasma after birth in newborn
lambs.  this study confirms this rise,
caused by an augmented mobilization of these
acids from the tissues.  norepinephrine
easily mobilizes free fatty acids in adult
ewes.  in newborn lambs this special effect
is lacking, though cardiovascular re-
sponses are clearly demonstrable.  blocking
the sympathetic nervous system in
newborn lambs inhibits the rapid rise of free
fatty acids after birth.  this is com-
patible with the concept, that increased activity
of these sympathetic nerves after
birth is an important factor for free fatty acids
mobilization.  during intrauterine
life there is an ample study of carbohydrates
and the organism uses them as an
energy source.  hypoglycaemia resulting from
sudden carbohydrate deprivation at
birth, demonstrates with rising free fatty acids
the change-over to (tissue) fat as
main source of energy.

1163. the effect of glucose infusions on the lipoid and the
carbohydrate metabolism of the parturient woman and
the fetus
in 20 parturient women who were given glucose
infusions during the expulsive stage
of labor, the authors were able to observe an unusual
hyperglycemia and a decrease
in unesterified fatty acids (uefa).  the uefa-level
usually increases regularly
during delivery.  likewise, the values of esterified
fatty acids (efa) showed an in-
crease above the normally present levels in women
who had received a glucose in-
fusion during the expulsive stage of labor.  the
results show that during delivery
both hyperglycemia and the increase in lipoids
are predominantly due to the energy
demands of the organism.  however, there is also
evidence that other, hitherto un-
known factors may play a role.  in the fetus,
the infusion of glucose leads to an in-
creased glucose retention.  the infusion, however,
does not bring about a decrease,
but, contrary to the expectations, an increase
in the uefa-values.  in general,
such a reaction is not found in any of the
subsequent periods of life.  further inves-
tigations were conducted in order to find an
explanation for the paradox uefa-
reaction.  as shown by an analysis of the lactic
acid and the pyruvic acid values, the
increase in the uefa can most probably not be
attributed to an impairment in the
fetal metabolic conditions.  the administration
of physiological saline infusions to
10 parturient women under equal conditions
revealed that the cause for the uefa-
increase can apparently neither be found in
hemodynamic changes due to the infusion
nor in changes of the electrolyte balance, but
rather in an adaptation insufficiency
of the fetal islet cells, respectively in a different
fat mobilization or fat deposition.

1320. the plasma free fatty acid composition and blood glucose
of normal and diabetic pregnant women and of their new-
borns
the blood glucose and plasma ffa content
and composition of the newborns of
normal women, gestational diabetics, and
insulin-dependent diabetics were analyzed.
normal maternal ffa levels were twice the
fetal values; by 2 hr of age ffa in-
creased 4-fold over initial values in normal
infants, while infants of gestational
diabetics had a 3-fold rise, and those of
insulin dependent diabetics only 2-fold.
blood sugar at the same time decreased and
there was an inverse relationship be-
tween blood glucose in the normal infants and
ffa.  this relationship is altered in
the infant of the diabetic mother.  gas
chromatography of plasma indicated a higher
ratio of unsaturated to saturated ffa in
mothers compared to infants.  no pattern
differences were noted between the normal
and diabetic mothers, except that the
latter had higher oleic acid.  in the initial 2
hr of life, the patterns changed, although
no differences were noted between infants
of diabetic mothers and normals.  the
observations suggest  (1) the metabolic
interrelationships of glucose and ffa in
the normal infant are different from those
in the infant of the diabetic mother, the
latter infant having a state of physiologic
hyperinsulinism; (2) plasma ffa in the
fetus is derived from both fetal fat synthesis
as well as placental transfers; (3) the
infant of the diabetic mother does not differ
from the normal as regards ffa com-
position.

(22.5%), colamine cephalin (13%)
and sphingomyelin (7.5%).  free cholesterol form-
ed 14% of the total lipids, while
cholesterol esters accounted for 6% and trigly-
cerides for 13%.  investigation of
the phosphatide fatty acids by gas chromatography
showed a content of 60% saturated,
27% simple unsaturated and 12% polyunsaturated
acids.  the fatty acids of the triglycerides
consisted of about 50% saturated and
25% each of simple and polyunsaturated
acids.  the polyenoic acids (30%) of the
cholesterol fatty acids had a high content
of linoleic acid, about one quarter that
of the total acids.

377. experimental study of sensitization to nickel
sensitization was effected by epicutaneous
application of nickel sulfate in
15 guinea-pigs.  it was confirmed by the
appearance of eczematiform lesions in
skin tests with nickel sulfate.  for maintenance
of the animals in good general
condition it was necessary to add vit. c and
antiinfective agents to the diet.
for this reason the allergenicity of the ni
salt had to be augmented by the use
of adjuvants (freund's complete adjuvant or alum).
such adjuvants act by
stimulating the res.  the method for
sensitization of guinea-pigs to metal salts
having been worked out, it is now proposed
to study the mechanism of such
sensitization, the biological disturbances
involved and the possible existence
of cross-sensitizations.

with special reference to
its role in nickel sensitivity
the reaction between nickel and proteins
was studied using the technique of
equilibrium dialysis.  in most of the experiments
crystalline bovine serum
albumen was used.  the nickel-protein complex
was of low stability, the quantity
of nickel bound by the protein being dependent
on the concentration of free
nickel ions, the ph, and the particular protein used.
the sites of binding of
the nickel ions were primarily carboxyl and amino
groups.  the author concluded
that it was unlikely that nickel behaved as a
hapten capable of initiating an
allergic response.

hyperkeratotic dermatitis of the palms, hand
eczema post partum, mycotic eczema,
contact dermatitis, occupational eczema and
idiopathic eczema.  the results
of the patch tests, the influence of
psychological and psychiatric factors,
the effect of water and cleansers, the
diagnosis, treatment and prognosis are
discussed.  in 39% no significant causative
factor could be found.  in
many cases where causative factors could
be identified these were probably
no more than contributory, superimposed

670.  steroid aerosol spray in contact dermatitis.
prophylactic use with
particular reference to nickel hypersensitivity
proper use of topical aerosol dexamethasone
(decadron) spray affords complete
protection to patients with nickel sensitivity.
this clinical result is
confirmed by the results of patch testing
nickel-sensitive patients with a
5% nickel sulfate solution and nickel coins.
a combination of dexamethasone and
an isopropylmyristate film is necessary
for successful prophylaxis; the
individual components alone do not protect
these patients.  clinical and patch
test results indicate that a moderate degree
of protection is afforded to
patients with paraphenylenediamine sensitivity.
patch test results indicate
that the spray does not protect against
poison ivy and ragweed oleoresin,
potassium dichromate, certain rubber accelerators,
and monobenzyl ether of
hydroquinone.  it affords a moderate protection
against formaldehyde.  no tests
were done with patients with formaldehyde
hypersensitivity.  a fair degree of
protection was obtained by the use of the spray
in housewives eczema presumably
due to irritants present in soap and detergents.

sensitization to metallic salts,
especially chromium and nickel.  in a series
of 20 cases of contact eczema
attributable to detergents, the existence of
sensitization to these metals was
demonstrated by the patch test.  likewise,
in the analysis of 9 samples of
different detergents used for washing,
in all of them chromium and nickel were
found to be present in a proportion which,
for either of these metals, varied
between 1 and 5 p.p.m.

the subcellular partition of nickel

wistar rats were exposed by inhalation to
nickel carbonyl either once only
at a concentration of 80 ppm for 60 minutes
(0.60 mg ni(co)4/l.air), or
repeatedly at 4 ppm (0.03 mg ni(co)4/l. air)
for 30 minutes 3 times weekly

(the final period of) exposure.
nuclear, mitochondrial, microsomal and supernatant

from lung and liver homogenates and measurements
of the nickel, nitrogen
and rna-content of each subcellular fraction
were made.  the greatest ratios
of nickel to nitrogen were in the nuclear

in the microsomal and

with metastases.  the lesions included the common types of pulmonary cancer,
squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma and anaplastic carcinoma.  all of
the pulmonary lesions were found between 24 and 27 mth. after the initial
exposure to nickel carbonyl.  the amount of nickel found capable of inducing
lung cancer in the rat was comparable to the amount of nickel inhaled by
persons smoking less than 15 cigarettes per day for a period of a year.  the
mean weight of rats chronically exposed to nickel carbonyl was found to be
consistently less than that of the control rats throughout the entire 3-year

4790. metal chelates as potential reactivators of organic phosphate poisoned
acetylcholinesterase
as part of a study to investigate metal chelates as possible reactivators
of phosphate poisoned acetylcholinesterase, it is shown that chelates act
as inhibitors of the enzyme.  in addition, copper and nickel chelates of
2-pyridinealdoxime catalyze the decomposition of dfp and sarin.  compared to
2-pam, however, these chelates are very poor reactivators, probably because
of an improper alignment of the oxine oxygen in the chelate-enzyme complex.

3446. effect of nicl2 on an isolated ranvier node
an attempt was made to explain the extreme prolongation of the nodal
potential by 0.1-1.0 mm nicl2 in terms of the ionic theory.  the effects of
nicl2 at room temperature are similar to those of temperature reduction
decreased maximum rate of rise of the action potential, lengthened action
potential duration, elevated threshold, increased tendency for repetitive
activity; in addition, the amplitude of the action potential is slightly
increased.  the long-lasting plateaus of the responses obtained under the
combined influence of nicl2 and temperature reduction are shortened by cathodal
polarization, strong anodal polarization and decrease of (na)0.  the plateau
can be prematurely terminated by short anodal pulses of critical amplitude;
short cathodal pulses reduce the duration of the plateau gradually with
increasing pulse strength.  increased (k)0 prolongs plateau duration; the
steep repolarization phase which normally terminates the plateau is
replaced by a long lasting after-depolarization with stepwise potential
decline.
the amplitude of k-depolarization is not influenced by nicl2 or temperature
reduction.  1.0 mm nicl2 changes the relation between maximum rate of
rise and steady-state polarization; the potential change required for 50%
sodium inactivation is +8mv in normal ringer's solution and +16mv in the
presence of 1.0 mm nicl2 (22 c.).  1.0 mm nicl2 increases the time constant
of delayed rectification as measured in na-poor solutions at 4 c. by a factor
of about 2.  the decrease of action potential under cathodal polarization is
slightly delayed by nicl2.  it is concluded that prolongation of the nodal
action potential by nicl2 is due to delayed and reduced inactivation of na
permeability and delayed increase of k permeability; part of the nicl2-effect
could be explained by assuming competition between ni++ and ca++ for specific
sites at the membrane.

2302. the carcinogenic activities of n-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene and its
metal chelates as a function of retention at the injection site
the carcinogenic activities of s.c. administered
n-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene
(n-hydroxy-aaf) and a variety of its metal chelates indicate that greater
activity locally is associated with a longer retention of the chelates at the
site of injection with a slow release of n-hydroxy-aaf to the surrounding
tissue.  no tumors were obtained at the sites of 4 injections of n-hydroxy-aaf
(3.2 mg. /injection), but 4 and 16 of 20 rats developed sarcomas at the
sites of 8 and 16 injections, respectively.  the nickelous, cobaltous, ferric,
or cupric chelates induced moderate to high incidences of sarcomas with 1 or 4
injections; in these cases one-half of the administered n-hydroxy-aaf was
retained at the injection site for 4-50 days.  the manganous and zinc chelates
and the potassium salt were less active at the injection site; the
half-retention times for these ranged from 2.5 hr. to 2.5 days.  the comparable
half-retention time for n-hydroxy-aaf was about 2 hr.  injection of the metal
derivatives s. c. with short half-retention times resulted in higher incidences
of mammary tumors than injection of the derivatives with half-retention
times of 4 or more days.  when administered in the food the cupric chelate
of n-hydroxy-aaf induced the same spectrum of tumors as n-hydroxy-aaf,
but the incidences were lower.  while the prolonged retention of the material
at the injection site may account for the greater carcinogenic activities of
the metal chelates, serious consideration must also be given to the possible
importance of chelation of carcinogens or their metabolites to cellular
constituents.

12083. generation of action potentials in single ranvier's nodes of isolated
frog nerve fibres under the influence of nickel and cadmium ions (russian)
by experimenting on single ranvier's nodes of frog isolated nerve fibres it
was shown that, along with a marked prolongation of the repolarization
phase of the action potential (ap), ni and cd ions also caused a rise of
the critical membrane depolarization level and an increased ap amplitude
with somewhat reduced steepness of its ascending phase.  ni and cd ions
restored the ap generation in the nodes of ranvier altered by a 0.01% procaine
solution, by an excess of potassium ions 00mm/1. of kcl) or by slight
mechanical injury during dissection.  it was only with a reduced na
concentration in the medium that the restoration of ap could be achieved.
ni and cd ions considerably slowed down and weakened the cathodal rise of the
critical level and the ap reduction.  cysteine (10 -2 to 10 -3 m)
eliminated all the effects of the mentioned ions.  a suggestion is made that by
binding the sh-groups of the nerve fibre proteins, nickel and cadmium reduce
the rate of inactivation and the increase of potassium permeability in
depolarization and also weaken the initial inactivation and the increase of
potassium permeability in depolarization, as well as weaken the initial
inactivation of the membrane (i-h), whenever this happened to be raised by
previous influences.

1287. agnostic alexia and constructive apraxia with regressive evolution in
a child of 12 yr. of age
after an acute encephalopathy, the etiology of which could not be determined,
a boy of 11 yr. and 10 mth. of age developed a syndrome of agnostic alexia
and constructive apraxia which was remarkably pure.  the intellectual
functions were normal as determined by iq tests, speech was not disturbed
either.  the child could not read or copy a text, but was fully able to write
(both freely and dictated).  the patient could not read what he had written.
this shows the characteristic features of agnostic apraxia.  motor activity and
performance were normal, but the child had extreme difficulty in constructing
geometric forms, even elementary, either spontaneously or by copying.

this is a very comprehensive study on a patient.  in the beginning there was

dyspraxia and constructive apraxia and dyslexia.  the autotopagnosia and mild
left-right disturbances showed marked regression.  actual hemianopsia was
not observed, but tachistoscopy revealed that perception of the right field of
vision was poor.  audiometric examination showed a conduction deafness and
disturbed binaural word synthesis.  the disturbances were examined
meticulously and tested for symptom relationships, which became evident
in the various factors concerned with creative ability.

a 56-year-old right-handed man, following the formation of a left posterior
subdural hematoma developed 'spelling dyslexia' and impaired picture
interpretation, which resolved, and color agnosia, which persisted.  the latter
impaired the use both of color information and of the names of the colors.
this may be explained as a disorder impairing the recollection and formation
of associations between color names and other types of information, with
resulting interference in any task in which colors or their names have
to be placed in a specific context.  the alternative views of willbrand (1887)
that here a limited dysphasia, and of sittig (1921) that a recognition defect
is simultaneously present, cannot be excluded.  in the present and in
previously reported cases the causative lesion seems to have been posteriorly
located in the dominant hemisphere, in the borderland between the area
receiving visual input and the language or verbal recording area.

652. bitemporal hemianopia
two stages can be distinguished in the development of bitemporal hemianopia
in hypophyseal tumors.  the first stage is the consequence of direct pressure
of the tumor on the lower side of the chiasma.  hence its start with upper
quadrantic field defects.  in this stage the visual disorder is amenable to
prompt and complete restoration.  with progressing growth of the tumor the
second stage follows as consequence of constriction by the circle of vessels.
in this stage nerve fibers are being destroyed.  therefore, after pressure
relieving operation no restoration occurs, or to a limited extent only.

387. ophthalmic manifestations of bilateral non-occipital cerebral lesions
twelve patients are described with neuro-ophthalmic symptoms resulting from
bilateral cerebral lesions in areas other than the occipital lobes.  the
symptoms and signs are categorized as follows  group i  those showing
predominant disturbances in visual object recognition (visual agnosia) and
disturbances of visual spatial localization.  group iia  those having defects
in voluntary control of eye movements (ocular motor apraxia).  group iib  those
with persistent palsies of conjugate gaze.  although these symptoms may be
present to some extent with unilateral lesions, they are much more profound
and less able to be compensated with bilateral lesions.  the evidence in the
present cases suggests a biparieto-temporal localization for the lesions
causing visual agnosia, disturbances of spatial localization, and ocular motor
apraxia, and a more frontal localization for the lesions causing prolonged
paralysis of conjugate gaze.

efficiency test which is of value in the appraisal of haemianopias, paracentral
and central defects of the visual field, in squint amblyopias and in
spontaneous nystagmus.

1303. the problem of visual agnosia
this is a critical assessment of the ancient and modern theories on visual
agnosia.  an original description of the subjective world of these patients is
also given.  visual agnosia is a rare disorder, but it has led to comprehensive
discussions, for instance, by the fact that the problem of normal visual
perception is always involved.  bay's view, which denies the existence of
agnosia as a separate phenomenon in perception disorders, is especially dealt
with.  it is affirmed that no case has been described in the literature
in which visual agnosia is decidedly a pure and isolated phenomenon.
mostly there are also disturbances in the intellectual interpretation of visual
data.  often there is metamorphopsia or asthenopia.  there is no localized
prestriate gnostic center for visual impressions.  the older concept of higher
and lower levels of perception and perception disorders is also criticized.
visual perception is not a passive, but a very active process, in which
neurophysiological and psychological aspects are involved.
each of these can be
disturbed, leading to various degrees of visual perception disturbance.

a survey of the effects of hyperbaric exposure on 62 medical personnel exposed

effect.  pain in the ears or sinuses was the most common symptom but could
often be ameliorated or avoided by the valsalva technique of forced
insufflation with the nostrils occluded.  the most serious symptoms
encountered were 3 episodes of transient homonymous hemianopsia.  the
classic symptoms of decompression sickness
extremity pains (the 'bends'), pulmonary or
substernal distress (the 'chokes'), and skin dysesthesias occurred only rarely,
and were so mild or so fleeting as to require no treatment.  a further
reduction in symptoms without increase in decompression time may be
obtained by the inhalation of 100% oxygen during decompression stops at
pressures below 26.8 pounds per square inch gauge (psig).

nonexistent when the patient simply viewed the material (static method) but
if the letter was slowly developed for them, they were able to identify it
(dynamic method).  one patient had vascular pathology which was considered
to involve both occipital lobes and the 2nd patient had the surgical removal of
the left occipital lobe for an angioma.

1388. optic agnosia  semeiological and pathogenetic aspects
the authors discuss the classical concept of agnosia and make a survey of
pathogenetical factors which determine its phenomenology.  the original and
traditional concept of such a term implied the loss of the capacity to
recognize objects, when the functions of sense organs are undamaged.  the
psychological studies on perception and the modern physiology of
vision allow to avoid the dichotomy between sensation and perception and
to affirm their identity.  cortex and recptors are closely bound and
function in unison.
every cortical alteration is thus reflected in sensorial functions; it is
therefore that on practical semeiological grounds it is possible to obtain a
congruous information of the corresponding cortical functionality through an
exploration of sense organs carried out by suitable means.  since we are
confronted with functional changes, exploration methods must be fit to evaluate
dynamic aspects of perception in connection with the temporalization and
spatialization of stimuli.  such methods are now quite numerous and often
complex  a particular stress is laid on local adaptation, flicker fusion, and
tachistoscopy on account of their significance and suitability.  by such
methods it is possible to show those functional deficits or pathological
disturbances of sensorial functions which are also behind the pathology of
visual recognition.  fluctuation, extinction, alteration in the perception of
movement, both real and apparent, changes in adaptation to light and
darkness are all phenomena which can be detected instrumentally and which,
at the same time, may be of determinant importance for the onset of 'agnosic'
behaviour.  the complexity of the latter, on the other hand, cannot always
be explained by sensorial disturbances only  other mechanisms, with a function
complementary but not less indispensable to the dynamics of perceptive
processes, may intervene and interfere in it.  on the basis of the latest
neurophysiological data the attention is called to ocular motility and
proprioceptivity, centrifugal innervation of sensorial receptors, and
vestibular afferences.  a particular clinico-pathogenetical significance is
attached by the authors to the association of lateral visual disturbances with
altered proprioceptive and kinesthetic information from the corresponding
half-body  such association in fact is nearly always present among the factors
responsible for the most strictly 'spatial' errors of 'agnosic' pathology.  in
the light of these pathogenetical considerations as well as of suitable
semeiological findings, the authors deem it convenient to divide their cases
into 3 categories with distinct clinical features  (a) cases in which altered
visual behaviour may be related to changes of the visual function and of its
complementary mechanisms; (b) cases in which hemianopia is associated with
a homolateral deficit of somatic proprioceptivity; (c) cases in which the
changes in behaviour are chiefly, but not only, due to a dissolution
of the symbolic sphere.

2568. clinical observations on hemianopia (japanese)
the clinical findings in 19 cases of hemianopia were analyzed.  hemianopia was
caused most frequently by vascular lesions of the central nervous mianopsia,
and by tumors.  wilbrand's prism sign, which is generally taken as evidence
of an optic tract lesion, was positive in one case with a parietal lesion.  no
case showed a cogwheel movement of the eyeball.  optokinetic nystagmus was
positive in 3 cases, one of which proved to have a parieto-occipital aneurysm.
the etiological factor could not be identified in the remaining 2 cases.
macular sparing was found to be symptomatic of an occipital lobe lesion.
incongruity of the 2 fields was observed in 2 cases with an occipital lobe
lesion.  as for the prognosis, hemianoptic field defects remained stationary in
cases of vascular lesions.  on the other hand perfect recovery of the visual
field defect occurred in cases with an occipital lobe tumor and in hypophyseal
hypertrophy caused by pregnancy.  the visual acuity of hemianoptic patients was
fairly good and no deterioration occurred during the observation period of
about 4 years.  only one patient out of the present series died.  these results
suggest that a favorable vital prognosis can be accorded to hemianoptic
subjects.

375. hemianopsia and glaucoma
after a discussion of the bibliographic references to the few observations on
the simultaneous occurrence of hemianopsias and glaucoma the author states on
the basis of his experiences the following points  homonymous hemianopsias
occasionally take place in glaucoma, although no direct relation can be
established between the former and the glaucoma.  it has to be pointed out,
however, that in other older patients, for example in those with retinal
detachment, neuritis, etc. who are likewise subjected to repeated and exact
perimetry, such hemianopsias do not occur, or are to be found at a lesser rate
than in glaucoma.  a homonymous hemianopsia has to be taken into consideration
also in the event of a sudden impairment of the visual field in a glaucomatous
patient or when the hemianopic defect supervenes in addition to the visual
field defect due to glaucoma.  in cases of binasal hemianopsia, the
simultaneous presence of glaucoma is not a rare incident.  whether the
binasal hemianopsia is the result of the gradual development of a
glaucomatous visual field with nasal defects or whether it constitutes an
independent symptom to a certain extent, cannot always be clarified
in the individual case.  obviously the condition of the basal cerebral
vessels plays a certain role in the development of glaucoma, even if
this role cannot be clearly defined as yet.  in cases of
binasal hemianopsia, a glaucoma has to be ruled out before radical diagnostic
and therapeutic measures are carried out.

1131. disorders of oculomotor functions in lesions of the optic pathway at the
parieto-occipital level and their significance in topical diagnosis
paresis of ocular movements to the hemianopic side is described in 9 patients
with acute vascular lesions in the parieto-occipital region.  in 7 cases the
paresis was of the dissociated type with inability to follow the moving finger,
while ocular movement in a verbally stated direction was quite normal.  in the
remaining 2 patients in whom the oedema extended into the frontal region there
was complete paresis of all conjugate movements.  conjugate paresis receded
hand-in-hand with the parietal symptomatology even if the hemianopia
persisted.  the oculomotor disorders referred to have never been observed in
lesions which did not extend beyond the occipital region.  conjugate
paresis has in all cases drawn attention to the presence of hemianopia
unobserved by the patients and this has led to a more accurate topical
diagnosis.

2120. thioguanine in the treatment of certain autoimmune, immunologic and
related diseases
the therapeutic effectiveness of 6-thioguanine has been evaluated over the past
3 years in 19 patients with diverse syndromes.  only patients with severe
debilitating disease unresponsive to conventional therapy were treated.
remissions occurred in 2 of 5 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, in 1
patient each with dermatomyositis and necrotizing angiitis, 2 patients with
psoriasis and 2 of 4 patients with atopic disease.  improvement occurred in
other patients with these diseases and in 2 of 4 patients with
neurodermatitis.  two patients with scleroderma experienced only
equivocal benefit.  significant toxicity attributable to the drug
was observed in 5 patients.  assessment of the eventual value of
these agents in therapy requires further study.  hypotheses regarding the
mechanism of action of these agents and the significance of clinical
response are discussed.

2469. the nature of collagen disease, particularly of systemic lupus
erythematosus (sle), with special reference to renal lesions (japanese)
from the results of examination of 161 autopsy cases of collagen diseases,
rheumatic fever and polyarteritis nodosa (pn) are considered as diseases of
hyperergic nature, showing pronounced specific manifestation in particular
organs.  as the reactivity becomes lower, this specific localization becomes
less significant and many organs become affected in sle.  it may accordingly be
supposed that sle is not a disease of hypersensitivity but one occurring in
a state of exhaustion of reactability after prolonged sensitization.  moreover,
a sle-like syndrome arises not only in the end stage of parasepsis, nephritis,
nephrosis and some cases of prolonged sensitization by myco.tb but also in
pn,pss,dm and rheumatism.  it may therefore be conceivable that sle is
a syndrome rather than a separate entity.  it is most important to consider
whether sle-like symptomatology may be regarded as a process equal to
an auto-immunization and whether the key to morphological elucidation of the
auto-immune phenomenon may lie hidden in this problem.

which produced 2 remissions in 6 consecutive cases total and in 4 cases
with severe nephropathy definite remission.  it should be emphasized that 5 of
the cases reported had definite npn elevation, accordingly they are considered
hopeless.

immunocytochemical observations
a firmly established case of lupus erythematosus with histologic
characteristics of periarteritis nodosa and fatal hemorrhage is presented.
immunocytochemical studies were done to explore the possibility of the vascular
lesions being immunological in type.  by immuno-fluorescent techniques
y-globulin, human serum complement, albumin and fibrinogen were demonstrated in
the vascular lesions.  y-globulin in the renal glomeruli was associated only
with complement.  the conclusion is that lupus erythematosus is primarily an
immunological disease with complex auto-immune mechanisms operative.

198. early experiences with azathioprine in ulcerative colitis.  a note of
caution
azathioprine was administered to 10 patients with ulcerative colitis classified
as 'very severe' in 2,'moderately severe' in 7 and 'relatively mild' in 1
patient, in conjunction with 'standard' therapy and adrenal corticosteroids in
8 of the 10 patients.  the possible beneficial therapeutic effects of
azathioprine in this small series cannot be evaluated definitively because of
the concurrent medication and the preliminary uncontrolled observations.
however, clinical improvement was apparent in 8 of the 10 patients; and in 2
patients, the favorable course occurred in the absence of steroid therapy.  in
2 additional patients, the favorable course was maintained during the
administration of azathioprine following the discontinuance of prolonged
steroid therapy.  in 1 patient, the administration of azathioprine was
associated with amelioration of an arthritis and pyoderma gangrenosum which did
not respond to the use of steroids and other medication.  immuno-suppressive
observations were limited.  the established delayed hypersensitivity response,
as reflected in various skin tests, was unchanged during the administration of
azathioprine.  azathioprine had no discernible toxic effects upon the kidneys
or the liver in 2 patients, 1 with postnecrotic cirrhosis and the other with
serum hepatitis.  gastro-intestinal symptoms (anorexia, epigastric discomfort,
and nausea) occurred in 8 patients.  mild to moderate leukopenia developed in 8
patients and, in 2 individuals, was accompanied by thrombocytopenia.  temporary
alopecia occurred in 1 woman.  the hematopoietic effects developed within 2 or
3 wk of therapy with azathioprine at a dosage level of 4-6 mg/kg/day.
azathioprine does not exert the rapid beneficial effect in ulcerative colitis
noted with corticotropin and adrenal corticosteroids.  therefore, its use in
severe ulcerative colitis requiring intensive therapy probably is undesirable.
azathioprine, on the basis of these initial observations, may be considered for
moderately severe ulcerative colitis, under circumstances permitting controlled
and prolonged therapeutic trial as adjunct medication, but with careful
supervision for prevention of toxicity, especially leukopenia.

248. data on etiology, pathogenesis, treatment results and survival period in
560 patients with cirrhosis of the liver
statistics were compiled from a total of 560 cases chosen at random, of
cirrhosis of the liver.  the figures refer to the age and sex of the patients,
as well as to the etiology and the hepatic morphology.  as the date of death of
304 of the subjects was known, it was possible to calculate the survival time
after the diagnosis was made.  only 36% survived the time of diagnosis by 1
year, 16% by 3 years, and 8% by 5 years.  these figures show that modern
therapy of liver cirrhosis has up to now not succeeded to prolong the life of
the majority of the victims.  in many cases, however, it is possible to a large
extent to relieve the patients' suffering by improving the appetite and the
general condition and by eliminating ascites and periods of hemorrhage and
stupor.  particular attention should be paid to the prophylaxis of the disease
and, by studying the survival time assessments and therapeutic reports, to the
method of selection of the subjects.

between active chronic hepatitis, lupoid hepatitis and sle was studied in 3
groups of 25 cases each.  a comparison was then made between the possible
etiological factors, the systemic manifestations, the survival rate, the
histological appearances, the biochemical tests, the autoimmune reactions
and the results of the immunosuppressive drugs.  from this study a concept
emerged according to which a proportion of cases of cirrhosis occurring in

immunized with sheep erythrocytes given intraperitoneally.  antigen was given
before, at the beginning, or in the middle of a 5-day course of drug
treatment.  chlormethine (mechlorethamine), 5-fluorouracil, and
5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine did not suppress the primary response
significantly.  methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine, 6-mercaptopurine roboside
and 2-amino-6-((1-methyl-4-nitro-5-imidazolyl) thio) purine
prolonged induction time and suppressed peak titer maximally
when immunization was performed one to three days prior
to drug treatment.  vinblastine did not affect peak titer, but did prolong
induction time when antigen was given 2 days prior to drug treatment.
cyclophosphamide markedly prolonged induction time and suppressed peak titer
irrespective of the time of antigen administration.  the antimetabolites
appeared to suppress maximally the intermediate stage of the primary response.

1959. analysis of mechanism of immunosuppressive drugs in renal
homotransplantation
dammin g. j.
a long-term study of the mechanism of action of immunosuppressive drugs has
been completed in bilaterally nephrectomized dogs with kidney homotransplants.
over 1,000 test animals with 24 different drug protocols have been analyzed.
increasing numbers of long surviving animals have posed many questions
regarding the status treated host.  the current drug protocol of azathioprine
and diazoacetylserine ('azaserine') has produced 90% 50-day survivors and 50%
100-day survivors.  the following observations have been documented  all
animals on prolonged drug therapy are immunologically competent; drug therapy
can be stopped successfully in some but not all animals; long surviving kidneys
apparently are protected in some way in the new environment because a
second donor kidney can be rejected while the first survives; retransplantation
of a long surviving kidney back to its original host did not lead to a decrease
in renal function; long surviving kidneys successfully retransplanted back
to their original donors are rejected when transplanted to third party,
non-drug treated recipients; immune paralysis does not account for the
prolonged survival because the second donor kidney which constitutes a double
dose of antigen is rejected while the first continues to survive; absorption or
metabolism of the drug does not account for the variation in results because
two kidneys, each from separate donors, can be rejected differentially in the
same drug treated host; and all hosts are sensitized against the recipient and
this sensitization continues even in those animals successfully weaned from
drugs.  additional analyses of the relationship of skin homografts and kidney
homografts reveal the following  skin homografts are universally rejected
within 20 days by hosts treated with the drug regimen which protects kidney
homografts sometimes permanently.  when skin and kidney homografts from the
same donor are placed simultaneously skin survival is prolonged while kidney
survival is shortened.  this paradoxical effect probably is explained by the
production of antibodies by skin which are absorbed by the rejecting kidney.
additional observations indicate that drug-treated animals, male and female,
are fertile and that multiple rejection processes can produce generalized
immunological picture in the host similar to an autoimmune disease process.

3083. myocardial toxicity of contrast agents used in angiography
the myocardial toxicity of many current and
some experimental contrast agents
has been studied in dogs, by use of a previously
unreported method of occlusion
retrograde coronary venography as well as the
familiar technique of selective
coronary arterial catheterization.  the following
conclusions appear justified in
the light of the experiments   not only the
iodine-containing radicals with which the
contrast agents are so often identified (acetrizoates,
diatrizoates, iothalamates,
etc.), but also the final salification products appear
to be responsible for the widely
divergent degrees of myocardial toxicity of contrast
agents, to the point that differ-
ent salts of the same compound behave as entirely
different agents both chemically
and biologically.  the results seem to indicate the
dominance of sodium ion and/or
the protective effect of methylglucamine salts with
respect to the myocardial toxi-
city of current radiopaque media.  reported,
yet unexplained, electrocardiographic
changes occurring within one to two seconds
from the beginning of massive caval
high-pressure injections appear to find a
causal relationship in the myocardial ir-
ritability induced by the distention of the
coronary veins and the myocardial infiltra-
tion which is intentionally enhanced with
our retrograde injection techniques.  a pe-
culiar trait, shared in varying degrees by
all radiopaque agents tested, is their
ability to increase coronary blood flow.
the clinical significance of this phenome-
non, however, remains to be established.
these studies re-emphasize the limita-
tions of the standard toxicity studies conducted
in animals.  it should be clear from
the results reported that agents to be
administered into the coronary circulation
demand investigation in regard to their
potential toxicity by the methods described
herein or variations thereof.  in fact,
similar tests should be carried out for all or-
gans to be subjected to radiographic
examination via the vascular bed.  the authors
hope that this presentation will stimulate
renewed investigation, particularly in view
of the growing clinical applications of
selective cardiovascular opacification tech-
niques.

2476. studies on cardiac dimensions in intact,
unanesthetized man. i. description of techniques and their
validation. ii. effects of respiration. iii. effects of
muscular exercise
a method is described which permits
measurement of relative changes in the exter-
nal dimensions of individual cardiac
chambers throughout the cardiac cycle in intact,
unanaesthetized man.  it consists of
suturing multiple radiopaque silver-tantalum
clips to the surface of the heart at the
time of cardiac operations.  in the postopera-
tive period, cineradiograms are
obtained and the distances between clips are mea-
sured on each individual frame.
this technique has been found to be safe and has
been employed in 68 patients without
any complications.  as a result of studies in 8
patients utilizing biplane serial exposures,
the effects of rotation of the heart in the
sagittal plane during the cardiac and
respiratory cycles were determined precisely.
if clips were properly placed on the heart,
the possible errors resulting from such
rotation were found to be quite small.
during inspiration right ventricular dimen-
sions increased, while the opposite occurred
during expiration and during the val-
salva manoeuvre.  left ventricular dimensions
exhibited little change during normal
respiration.  during deep, slow inspiration,
the changes in dimensions of the left
ventricle lagged behind those of the right
ventricle by 1 to 5 (generally 2 or 3) car-
diac cycles; the magnitude of the changes in
the dimensions of the left ventricle was
smaller than that which occurred in the right
ventricle.  the effects on ventricular
dimensions of light muscular exercise performed
in the supine position were studied
in 9 patients.  the end-diastolic dimensions
decreased by an average of 6.0% of con-
trol in the right ventricle, and by an average of
5.1% in the left ventricle.  end-sys-
tolic dimensions decreased by an average of 5.6%
of control in the right ventricle
and by an average of 6.5% in the left ventricle.
these decreases are considered to
approximate one-half of the resting stroke volume.
in the 4 patients in whom the
rate of right ventricular pressure rise was determined
continuously, exercise re-
sulted in an elevation of dp/dt while ventricular
end-diastolic dimensions decreased.
these data are interpreted to indicate that an
increase in myocardial contractility
occurs during muscular exercise in man.

internal hydrocephalus as well as
assessing the efficiency of surgical shunts; the
latter technique may be useful in
the study of normal csf circulation as well as
in cases of csf leaks, arachnoiditis

3762. aberrant left coronary artery
five cases of aberrant coronary artery are
presented, with emphasis on the angio-
graphic features and differentiation from
endocardial fibroelastosis.  clinical and
electrocardiographic features may suggest
the proper diagnosis, but only angio-
graphy can conclusively demonstrate the
continuity between the pulmonary artery
and the left coronary artery.  in these cases,
blood flow was from the pulmonary
artery to the coronary artery (forward) in 2
cases, and from the coronary artery
to the pulmonary artery (retrograde) in the
other 3.  when the diagnosis of aberrant
coronary artery is suspected, selective
left-sided angiocardiography should be the
angiographic procedure of choice.  the differentiation
from endocardial fibroelas-
tosis and other myocardiopathies is usually not a
problem with such a study, but
may be more difficult with intravenous angiocardiography.
with this latter type of
study, the coronary arteries are not generally visible,
but a persistently thin la-
teral aspect of the left ventricular wall should suggest
the proper diagnosis.  sub-
sequent confirmation by a left-sided injection is advisable.

4159. detection of heart shunts by means of i 125
external scintillation detection of a pure dilution
curve originating in the right ven-
tricle has been pursued by investigators for many
yr.  the use of the soft photons
of 125 i offers an improved method of determination
by allowing excellent collimation
through 2 mechanisms  (1) a small half value layer
of 2 cm in tissue, and (2) uni-
directionality, in part due to all-or-none photoelectric
absorption of these photons
as compared with the pluridirectionality due to compton
scatter in the case of 131 i.
in 30 normal individuals, externally detected dilution
curves from the right heart
ventricle and arterial dilution curves obtained by arterial
puncture are compared.
five hundred microcuries of 125 i are injected into an
antecubital vein.  the amount
of radiation absorbed from a 500 uc dose in an adult of
70 kilos is 1000 to 2000
mrads when injected in the form of 125 i iodide.  the use
of 125 i orthoiodohippu-
rate is advised due to its short biological half-period and
the integrated whole-body
radiation exposure is decreased 100-fold in comparison
with the 125 i iodide.  the
shape of the right heart curve is very similar to the arterial
dilution curve with a
13   5% excess of counts originating outside the right ventricle
area.  the descending
segment of the right ventricle curve has a minimum count rate
of only 12   2% of the
peak of the curve as compared with the arterial curve of 10
   2.5%.  a mean t 1/2
of the descending down slope of the right ventricle is 1.52
   0.45 sec. for the right
heart curve and 2.4   0.65 sec. for the arterial curve.
the clinical usefulness of this
procedure in 20 patients with atrial septal defects and 9
patients with ventricular sep-
tal defects is analyzed.  it seems possible to perform selective
right-heart radiocardio-
graphy by means of external precordial detection of 125 i.  the
method is simple and
reproducible.

cardiac output and pulmonary blood volume by means
of the method of quantitative
radiocardiography.  the instrumentation is simple,
the technique is easy to perform
and causes little trouble to the patients, only one
injection of about 50 uc of rihsa
being needed.  thirty-nine patients aged 17-83 yr.,
free of cardiovascular or re-
spiratory disorders, were studied.  the results
obtained are in close agreement with
previous reports.  only the cardiac index showed a
significant decrease with age,
while the reduction of blood volume and of pulmonary
blood volume was slight.  a close
statistical correlation was found between pbv and sv,
and was interpreted as a
dependence of pbv on sv.

2725. demonstration of myocardial infarction by photoscans of
the heart in man
intravenously injected radioiodinated oleic acid
was incorporated into heart muscle
in sufficient concentration to permit recording photoscans
of the heart in man.  in
3 fatal cases of massive septal myocardial infarction,
injection of the radioiodin-
ated fatty acid (rifa) was made during life; at necropsy
photoscans of the excised
heart showed a discrete area of absent radioactivity
corresponding to the infarcted
interventricular septum.  photoscans of the heart were
made during life in 42 pa-
tients, 9 of whom had suffered recent myocardial infarction.
there were definite
areas of deceased radioactivity corresponding to the location
of the infarction,
judged by the electrocardiogram, in 4, and probable areas of
decreased radioactivity
in 2, of the 9 cases of myocardial infarction.  the technic as
presently employed
just approaches the limits of definition of infarction in acute
cases.  modification of
the biochemical principles or further development of the
y-camera may bring the
method to a level of diagnostic usefulness.

2716. y-angiocardiography
recordings were made, simultaneously with
the y-cardiogram, of a pulmonary an-
giogram by means of a collimator placed in
the left scapular region and of carotid
angiogram by a collimator centered on the axis
of the external auditory canal.  the
3 curves yielded very interesting information on
the chronology of the various car-
diac cycles.  the pattern of the pulmonary and
carotid y-angiograms was valuable
in several pathologic conditions.  it is more logical
to measure the cardiac output
on the carotid curve than on the y-cardiogram,
especially if there are shunts.  the
pulmonary curve allows rectification of the time
constant of emptying of the left
cavities of the heart.  as regards chronologic
information on cardiac cycles, atten-
tion is drawn to the fact that in the pulmonary
circulation long and short circuits
can be demonstrated.  the characteristic times
can be measured.  between the time
that the radioactive material appears in the left
cavities and the time that it leaves
the carotid, there is an interval of 3-4 systoles,
which represents the time neces-
sary for left circular filling.  the validity of
calculation of the cardiac output with
the stewart-hamilton formula is discussed.
this is valid if the collimator covers
a small volume of the principal channel.  it remains
to be shown if such a calculation
is valid for larger cavities, or for 2 cavities, through
which the radioactive material
passes successively, and which have different c (t)
functions as well as for all tissue
'seen' by the collimator, some of which are not yet
irrigated with the radioactive
blood, while in other areas recirculation has already
started.  these aspects, and
their application to the pulmonary angiogram, are
discussed in detail.  with the
authors' technique, y-angiogram is
especially valuable, as correc-
tion for the time constant of the decrease of the left
peak is based on the lengthening
of this curve.  this again serves as a basis for
determining the left ventricular
volume.

output were found to be decreased

ratio diminished, and the pul-
monary circulation time prolonged.  the results

lar capacity, right ventricular resting blood volume
and pulmonary blood volume

registration of i 131 injected into the aorta at different levels
a technique for localizing shunts of aortic origin
is described, based on the analysis
of precordial records of i 131 injected at different
aortic levels.  seven patients with
patent ductus arteriosus (pda), 1 with a
coronary av fistula, 2 with ventricular
septal defect (vsd), 1 with atrial septal defect
(asd), 3 with mitral regurgitation,
2 with aortic regurgitation and 2 with systemic
hypertension were studied.  retro-
grade arterial catheterization by seldinger's
technique was performed in all the
patients, as well as right-sided catheterization
in those with congenital cardiopathies,
and transseptal catheterization in those with
valvulopathies.  a dose of 5-15 uc of na
i 131 was injected at the levels of the aortic root,
the ascending aorta, the aortic arch,
the origin of the left subclavian artery (ductus
level) and the descending aorta (post-
ductus level).  precordial curves were obtained by
means of a 2-inch thallium-acti-
vated nai crystal focused over the 3rd left intercostal
space at the sternal margin.
the shunt outlet can be detected by obtaining
simultaneous venous dilution curves
from the right chambers and the pulmonary artery.
the latter technique was used
in 2 patients with pda, 1 with coronary av fistula
and 1 with vsd.  these curves
were obtained by continuous withdrawal of blood which
had flowed through a well
scintillation counter.  the crystal pulses were carried
to ratemeters which worked
with the following time constants  0.01-0.15 sec for the
precordial curves and 0.5
sec for the venous curves.  a direct recorder with a
5-mm/sec paper speed was
used.  normal precordial curves after injecting above
the aortic valve were obtained
in patients with arterial hypertension, mitral regurgitation
and asd and vsd.  a
swift downslope which fell down near the baseline level and

1671. the use of 99m tc pertechnetate in cardiac scanning
technetium 99m pertechnetate has been utilized
in the aas' laboratory for scanning the
cardiac blood pool.  the delineation of the heart
pool and surrounding vasculature
is comparable to that obtained with the standard
131 i compounds now in use.  in the
authors' hands 99m tc had the following advantages
since they routinely utilized
99m tc for brain and thyroid scans, it is available,
eliminating the purchase and
shelf decay of other materials.  three to 5 mc quantities
may be administered
with relatively low patient radiation dosage.  the
associated high count rate permits
rapid scanning.  the identification of pericardial effusions
is enhanced by the radio-
activity in the stomach which in some cases becomes
abnormally separated from
the cardiac blood pool.

the physical properties, metabolism and
radiation dose of tc 99m are discussed and
compared with those of i 123, i 125, i 131 and i 132.
it is shown that with tc 99m the highest
'in vivo' counting rates are obtained for a
given internal radiation dose, so that mea-
surements of high statistical accuracy may
safely be made.  the y-ray energy is near
optimum for scanning and the observation of
transients allowing light-weight collima-
tors to be used.  while tc 99m tagged albumin
is considered superior to risa for ap-
plications such as brain scanning, placentography
and the measurement of cardiac
output, i 123 if it becomes available will be preferable
for thyroid scanning.

2626. a study of central arteriovenous shunts by
precordial recording of radioalbumin dilution curves
precordial dilution curves of 185 patients were
studied, 56 of them without cardio-
vascular disease, 48 with central arteriovenous
shunts and 45 with various cardiac
diseases.  collimation was not used, allowing only
minimal quantities of radioactive
material (0.5-2.2 uc. of i 131-tagged albumin) to be
utilized.  the precordial focusing
zone was a critical factor in this technique.  the
application of different discrimina-
tion factors, among them the ratio between the
minimal concentration and the latter
-an index proposed here - made possible the
diagnosis in 46 of the 48 patients with
shunts.  this method was shown to be as sensitive
as classical oximetry done during
cardiac catheterization.  the curves in pure valvular
stenosis do not show similar
changes to the shunts.  on the other hand, these
changes are shown in certain val-
vular regurgitations.  this fact becomes the most
important limiting factor in the
diagnosis of central arteriovenous shunts.  cardiac
failure does not preclude the
diagnosis, providing one can exclude valvular
regurgitation by other means.  the
method is thus, in spite of its limitations, of extreme
value in diagnosing central
arteriovenous shunts, especially when the results are
analyzed together with clinical

scopic study
an electron microscopic study was made
of 8 squamous cell, 3 undifferentiated,
and 3 alveolar carcinomas of the lung on
biopsy specimens embedded in methacryl-
ate.  the squamous cell carcinomas were
found to contain cylindrical cells with
glycogen granules, scanty mitochondria,
a reticular endoplasm which was chiefly
vesicular, numerous free ribosomes,
and bundles of confluent fibrils in the desmo-
somes.  the authors also observed in
the center of the tumor nodes, cells richer
in tonofibrils which enveloped the
nucleus, and cells in which all the cytoplasmic
organelles had almost disappeared
except for tonofibrils or cells packed with
keratohyalin and even lipid granules
sometimes arranged in lamellar formations
of the myelin type.  the picture as a
whole was that so often seen in the optic
microscope tumor foci formed of
slightly differentiated cells at the periphery
which became more differentiated
as one approaches the center.  the undifferenti-
ated cells resembled more the
intermediate bronchial cells than the basal cells.

1375. loss of neoplastic properties in vitro. ii. observations on
kb sublines
ten sublines of the kb cell line obtained from
a number of different laboratories
were reexamined with respect to chromosome
number and heterotransplantability
to the syrian hamster cheek pouch.  twelve
clonal cultures derived from 2 of these
sublines were similarly examined.  three
sublines differed from one another and
from the kb cell line originally studied,
which was heterotransplantable with inocula
of circa 10 cells.  only 2 of the sublines
could be heterotransplanted with inocula
of less than 10 4 cells; 5 were heterotransplantable
with inocula of 10 4-10 6 cells; and
2 failed to heterotransplant, even with
inocula of 10 6 cells.  similar differences in
heterotransplantability were observed
among the clonal derivatives of 2 of these
sublines.  although the modal numbers of
these sublines and clonal derivatives were
basically similar, ranging from 73 to 80,
a few lines had a chromosome of sufficient-
ly distinctive morphology to serve as a
marker.  there was, however, no apparent
correlation between these minor karyotypic
differences and heterotransplantability.
possible differences between non-heterotransplantable
and heterotransplantable
sublines with respect to the pattern of
variability in cytoplasmic protein and cyto-
plasmic ribonucleic (rna) content per cell
remain to be studied in detail.  for i of this

cells from the 10th subculture on subcutaneous
injection into mice produced tumors
identical with those produced by the original
cells.  judged by the time taken to kill
mice on intraperitoneal injection the tissue
culture cells were not as malignant as

invasion in cultures of normal tissue combined with malignant cells
normal myocardium of newborn c3h mice was
cultivated in vitro in contact with
homologous sarcomatous cells (strain n1 and
strain nctc) and studied by micro-
cinematography for 22 days.  it was found that
the tumor cells tend to move apart,
and with more vigorous and rapid movements
some of them called 'commando's'
make their way into the group of normal
cells but are arrested wherever they meet
a compact group of these cells.  this then
demonstrates, on the one hand, direct
aggresivity of the tumor cells and, on the
other, the 'group' defence of the normal
cells.

sheets obtained by mechanical scraping of
the original culture when it was 14 mth

with the morphological appearance of
plasma cells, were seen in the subcultures.

a metastasising pleomorphic adenocarcinoma

transplanted to 4 brothers by the 'plating'
technique of henderson and rous.  by
'plating' multiple small grafts in air bells in
the subcutaneous tissues of the new hosts
it was possible to select 4 different clones
of transplantable tumour for further study.
the histological peculiarities of
different parts of the original tumour
were reproduced in the different clones a i,
ii, iii, and b.  retrospective study
of the primary tumour and of its metastases
provided some interesting clues to routes
of metastasis and the selective survival of
malignant cells.  it is concluded that by
the cloning of transplantable cells, at the
first serial passage, valuable information
about the histogenesis and potential
malignancy of the primary tumour can be
obtained.  lastly, the highly malignant
character of 4 clones of tumour cells apparently
derived from the familiar clinically
benign adenoma of the mouse lung may
be of some interest, from the point of
view of prognosis based on histology.

2379. in-vitro culture of pulmonary tumors in hamsters caused by adenovirus 12
it is known that the adenoviruses 12 and
18 provoke malignant tumors in the
new-born hamster.  the authors made a study
of the histogenesis of these tumors and
examined the specific changes brought about
in the cells by the virus infection
malignancy, presence of viral antigen, reactions
to superinfection.  when new-born
hamsters were inoculated in the chest with
adenovirus 12, malignant tumors
developed in one or two months, in 16 animals
out of 22.  these tumors presented
an epithelial aspect and were of bronchiolo-alveolar
origin.  they were transplant-
able in vivo; if they were cultured in vitro,
they consisted in the first few cultures of
macrophages, fibroblasts and epithelium.
in subsequent passages, there was a
progressive disappearance of the macrophages
and fibroblasts.  in some cases, the
culture after seven passages was of a purely
epithelial nature, and when it was
reimplanted into hamsters at this time it
gave rise to the rapid development of an
epithelial tumor.  in the tumor cultures,
no adenovirus could be demonstrated.
nor could cultures of the pulmonary tumors,
or cultures of normal hamster lung be
infected with adenovirus.  it appears that the
lung of the hamster in an organotyp-
ical culture constitutes a means of choice
for the malignant transformation of
adenovirus 12.

normal (hsl) antigens in stable human cell lines
the existence of abnormal human stable
line (hsl) antigens common to a
number of stable human cell lines, but
absent from normal human tissues and
normal human diploid cell strains in tissue
culture, was demonstrated by agar gel
microimmunodiffusion.  hsl was detected
in hela-sj, hela-mba, hela-s3,
chang conjunctiva, syverton's embryo
esophagus, chang liver, and j-iii.  it
was not detected in henle's human intestine
or detroit-6.  it was absent from two
normal diploid strains, wi-38 and sj-dhl,
and was not found in a variety of
concentrated extracts of fresh human
organs.  hsl was not associated with
contamination by pleuropneumonia-like
organisms (pplo) of cell lines.  the
purest hsl preparations obtained from hela-sj
by ammonium sulfate fractiona-
tion yielded absorption spectra characteristic of
protein and were inactivated by
trypsin.  sephadex chromatography indicated a
particle weight of approximately
150,000; hsl was not sedimented at 125,000 x g.
in 0.02 m po4 buffer, activity
was virtually completely eliminated after 2 minutes
at 50 c., 8 minutes at 45 c.,
or 80 minutes at 40 c.  preliminary studies with
fluorescent anti-hsl globulin
indicated that hsl was not a surface antigen;
rabbit antisera to purified hsl
fractions were not cytotoxic to hela cells.
the best preparations of hsl still
contained a trace of common human antigen
and appeared to consist of multiple
components active in immunoprecipitation.

homogeneity of this material.

2774. pitfalls in the clinical and histologic diagnosis of broncho-
genic carcinoma
a necropsy study of 380 cases of extrathoracic
carcinoma revealed that pulmonary
metastases occurred in almost 50% of the
cases and bronchial metastases in over
25%.  there were 39 cases (10.3%) in the
series with clinical features simulating
bronchogenic carcinoma and in 24 (62%)
of these cases there was cytologic and/or
histologic confirmation.  carcinomas of
the pancreas presented the greatest source
of diagnostic error accounting for more
than one-third of the 39 cases; the primary
site second in frequency was carcinoma
of the kidney.  bronchial metastases were
chiefly responsible for the clinical,
cytologic, and histologic findings compatible
with the diagnosis of bronchogenic
carcinoma.  secondary growths in the lungs may
present roentgenologically as solitary
tumors indistinguishable from primary lung
cancer.  metastatic lesions in lymph
nodes, bronchi, and lung may exhibit pleomor-
phic features simulating squamous
cell carcinoma.  the diagnosis of bronchioloalveo-
lar carcinoma in resected lung tissue
is a presumptive conclusion inasmuch as the
identical morphological features may
be reproduced by metastases from duct or
glandular carcinomas.  the simulation
of bronchogenic carcinoma by metastatic tum-
ors occurs with sufficient frequency to
challenge the diagnostic accuracy of deaths
certified as bronchogenic carcinoma
with necropsy exclusion of other primary sites.

4396. effects of arginine deprivation, ultraviolet radiation,
and x-radiation on cultured kb cells.  a cytochemical and
ultrastructural study
cultured kb cells (derived from a
human oral carcinoma) grown in monolayers
were injured by one of three agents
starvation by arginine deprivation or treatment
with high doses of either ultraviolet
radiation or x-radiation.  the different agents
produced changes in nucleolar structure
and varying accumulations of triglyceride
and glycogen.  all three agents produced
an increase in number and size of lyso-
somes.  these were studied in acid
phosphatase preparations, viewed by both light
and electron microscopy, and, occasionally,
in vital dye, esterase, and aryl sul-
fatase preparations.  ultrastructurally,
alterations in lysosomes suggested that
'residual bodies' developed in a variety
of ways, i.e., from the endoplasmic retic-
ulum, multivesicular bodies, or autophagic
vacuoles.  following all three agents,
the endoplasmic reticulum assumed
the form of 'rough' or 'smooth' whorls, and,
after two of the agents, arginine
deprivation or ultraviolet radiation, it acquired
cytochemically demonstrable acid
phosphatase activity.  near connections between
the endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomes
raise the possibility that in kb cells, at
least when injured, the endoplasmic
reticulum is involved in the formation of
lysosomes and the transport of acid
phosphatase to them.

1106. the simultaneous use of extracorporal circulation and hypothermia in the
surgery of the heart
the operative technique of cardiac
surgery under conditions of deep hypothermia with
simultaneous use of a pump oxygenator
and cardiopulmonary bypass is described.  in
the majority of cases the patients were
cooled with water at 2 c. and the perfusion
volume was reduced by more than 50%
during hypothermia.  in others, a gradient of
10 c. between blood and water was
maintained and the perfusion volume was reduced
by less than 50%.  the data presented
show that neither technique leads to hypoxic
changes in the cerebrum and internal
organs, provided the mean arterial pressure
is kept between 70 and 90 mm. hg during perfusion.
the overall mortality in the
authors' 168 cases - most of which
had congenital heart disease - was 14.8%.  in 53
cases of tetralogy of fallot - most
of them cyanotic - the vsd was closed by taking
a flap of tissue from the crista supraventricularis.

expressed both as absolute values
and as percentages of normothermic values.
at normothermia, dogs with closed
chest had an ascending aorta flow of 154%
and a left ventricular external power of
183% of the corresponding values for dogs
with open chest.  both ascending aorta
flow and left circumflex coronary artery flow
were reduced to 25% of normothermic level
at 20 c.  aortic arch mean pressure was
reduced to 50% of normothermic level
at 20 c.  total peripheral resistance was
increased to 205% of normothermic level
at 20 c.  left ventricular external power
was decreased to 11% of normothermic
level at 20 c.  left ventricular oxygen
consumption was decreased to 31% of nor-
mothermic level at 20 c.  mechanical

pump oxygenator
the advantages of hypothermia of below 10 c for 2 hr,
induced and maintained by
extracorporeal circulation of 200 min.,
were compared to partial bypass of the
same duration during normothermia.
in the normothermic group 9 dogs out of 12
lived.  in the hypothermic group 6 dogs
out of 15 (40%) survived when perfused at
the high flow of 55 cc/kg/min.  eleven
dogs out of 15 (70%) survived when the flow
rate was reduced to 25 cc/kg/min when
the temperature was below 10 c.  the death
in the high flow group were due mainly
to postperfusion lung changes even when low
pulmonary venous pressure was assured
by venting in the left atrial chamber.  me-
tabolic acidosis occurred in all groups;
though greater in the high flow, with the
low flow intermediate between the former
and the normothermic group.  this change
to a great degree, can be explained by the lung changes.

neurologic surgery
forty-three patients with bleeding intracranial
aneurysms were operated on under
deep hypothermia and with the aid of extracorporeal
circulation.  the open-thorax
method was used in 18 cases and the closed-thorax
method in 25.  the following
points are made  (1) the closed-thorax method
is considered superior to the open-
thorax method in several respects; (2) meticulous
hemostasis is essential to control
the oozing that occurs during extracorporeal
circulation under profound hypothermia
until the heparin antagonist can become
effective and body temperature can return
to normal; (3) significant thrombocytopenia
may develop during extracorporeal cir-
culation, and inhibition of the thrombin-fibrinogen
reaction by factors other than
heparin may cause a major coagulation defect
and may also, by mimicking the he-
parin effect, lead to the excessive use of
heparin antagonists; (4) pathologic changes
in microcirculation during extracorporeal
circulation may be determinants of a
hemorrhagic tendency.

4088. the use of hypothermia and dehydration in the treatment of severe
cerebral hypoxia
the rational for using hypothermia or
cerebral dehydration is to suppress or re-
verse progressive or delayed cerebral
damage after hypoxia.  it is suggested that
damage of this nature results from injury
to the astroglia and oligodendroglia,
especially the former.  experimental and
clinical evidence favors lowering of the
body temperature immediately after any
episode of hypoxia accompanied by impor-
tant damage to the brain.  the rational
for using dehydration is insecure and its
results are uncertain.  this treatment
should probably be reserved for cases in
which a raised cerebrospinal fluid pressure
has been proved, and in which other
measures, especially hypothermia,
are either not available or have failed.

7828. selective cerebral hypothermia  physiology and technic
a safe, suitable technique for producing
selective brain cooling by a perfusion
method is described.  of 15 dogs, 7 survived.
the salient features aiding survival
are discussed.  the use of a direct vasodilator
(papaverine) in the perfusate to
relieve vasospasm markedly reduced cooling time
and represented the most signi-
ficant technical advance over previously
described methods.  an acid base analysis
utilizing the siggaard-andersen curve nomogram
was performed on 4 dogs and no
significant acidosis noted during selective brain
cooling.  a definite arteriovenous
lactic acid difference developed at hypothermic
temperatures indicating the brain
may metabolize this substance in preference to
glucose at lowered brain tempera-
tures, the reasons for which were discussed.
the rate of disappearance of physi-
cally dissolved oxygen (po2) was measured
in the brain following ischemia at dif-
ferent temperatures.  the average rate of
disappearance at 20 c. was 40% of the
rate at 37 c.  the discrepancy between this
finding and the in vitro oxygen utili-
zation rate at the same temperature was discussed.

948.cardiac activity in cranio-cerebral hypothermia
the onset of hypothermia rarely alters the heart
rate.  as it deepens to 35-32, the
rate slows, and at the level of 30-29 it usually
amounts to only half its original va-
lue.  at 28 or below, the development of
bradycardia is observed.  after warming
to 32 the normal heart rate is restored.
during operations on the abdominal organs
the heart rate is only slightly modified.
the appearance of solitary extrasystoles is
rare and is usually associated with stimulation
of the diaphragm.  the most marked
changes in the heart rate are observed during operations on the heart,
especially if
it is excluded from the circulation.  an
idioventricular rhythm may develop before
the heart stops beating.  after removal of the
ligatures from the venae cavae the nor-
mal rhythm is restored.  as the temperature
falls, the excitability of the myocardium
increases.  conduction is more resistant.
areflexia continues even during direct sti-
mulation of reflexogenic zones.  in the surgical
stage of cranio-cerebral hypothermia
it is clear that no significant degree of energy
or hemodynamic insufficiency deve-
lops, whether in experimental conditions or
during operations on patients.  at opera-
tion a well-marked stabilization of the contractile
power of the myocardium may be observed.

946. respiration in hypothermia.  i. respiratory pattern and
acid-base balance in the blood
mongrel dogs, under light pentobarbital anesthesia,
were made hypothermic by im-
mersing them in ice water and then normothermic
in warm water.  in the course of
cooling, the respiratory rate and pulmonary
ventilation, after an initial increase,
were reduced as the rectal temperature fell,
and spontaneous respiration was ar-
rested at rectal temperatures of 21-25 c.
alveolar pco2 was increased, after an
initial slight lowering, with the progress of
hypothermia.  arterial ph and standard
bicarbonate (jorgensen and astrup) decreased,
and the alkalinity of the blood coh/
ch (winterstein) decreased markedly during hypothermia.
these findings suggest
both respiratory and metabolic acidosis as the
mechanisms concerned.  in the course
of rewarming all these changes disappeared rapidly
and completely though the venti-
latory stimulation observed as an initial transitory
phenomenon during cooling failed to occur.

896. studies on blood viscosity and its significance in anesthesia
the principles for measuring blood viscosity
have been discussed.  although blood
does not behave in a newtonian manner,
the data obtained in in vitro measurement
are useful.  a modified simple method for
measuring blood viscosity relative to nor-
mal saline has been described.  there is
essentially no difference in viscosity be-
tween fresh blood and heparinized blood and between plasma and serum.
viscosity varies with the quantity and nature of proteins
in plasma and the cellular concentra-
tion.  halothane and thiopental sodium reduce
blood viscosity and seem to be indicat-
ed in conditions in which there is hemoconcentration
and a tendency for red blood
cells to aggregate.  cyclopropane, hypothermia,
and norepinephrine tend to raise
blood viscosity and would seem to be contraindicated
when the microcirculation is failing.
.I 418

4612. flow considerations in regional cerebral hypothermia
it is suggested that low flows are dangerous
and may cause anoxia either directly
or by interfering with cooling.  sixty dogs
have been subjected to local cerebral
hypothermia by the method of femoral to
carotid cooling of arterial blood with per-
fusion at a predetermined pressure rather
than predetermined flow rate.  the cir-
cuit is described and its advantages for
clinical use mentioned together with its in-
accuracies as a method of scientific investigation.
these are chiefly concerned
with maintenance of systemic blood pressure
which may require the injection of
pressor agents.  evidence for reduction in flow
at low temperatures is discussed
and evidence presented that this is not only due
to increase in viscosity but that
there is an active spasm, manifested by
'rewarming humps' which occur in the
cooling graphs.  mean carotid flow rates
were determined by a revolution counter
attached to a pump of fixed stroke volume,
the output of which was linked to the per-
fusion pressure and thus determined by the resistance.
the place of added co2
is discussed particularly in relation to the fall
in partial pressure which accompa-
nies the cooling of the blood.  the addition of 5% co2
did not increase total carotid
flows.  halothane had been used as an anesthetic
because of its sympatholytic ac-
tion.  it has increased flows by 37% and
abolished 'rewarming humps'.  rheomacro-
dex used as a priming fluid instead of blood
produced increased flow averaging 75%
but did not abolish spasm.  it is suggested that
cooling faster than 1 c. per minute
is not intrinsically dangerous if spasm is prevented
and high flow maintained by the methods described.

4613. selective brain cooling produced by cerebral ventricular perfusion
hypothermic cerebral ventricular perfusion
was applied to dogs.  shivering appear-
ed to be directly related to the cns temperature
rather than the peripheral body
temperature.  selective heating of the brain-stem
produced panting.  rewarming
of the body was retarded by the initiation of heat
loss mechanisms controlled cen-
trally when hyperthermic perfusion was used.
shivering disappeared but panting
was unaffected by pentobarbital anesthesia.
cooling of one or both frontal areas and
the anterior part of the third ventricle did not
significantly affect the respiratory
or circulatory systems but brain-stem hypothermia
produced distinct respiratory
and circulatory reactions.  it is suggested that
cooling of the 3rd and 4th ventricu-
lar areas may be utilized for anesthetic purposes.

1139. optimal coronary flow in the bypassed normothermic and hypothermic heart
a series of experiments were conducted in dogs
in which bypass flow, temperature,
and direct coronary perfusion pressure were varied.
coronary flow, coronary ven-
ous saturation, myocardial oxygen consumption (mvo2),
and coronary vascular re-
sistance were assayed.  coronary flow as a percentage
of total bypass flow did not
vary appreciably at varying levels of bypass flow.
induction of hypothermia, when
total bypass flow is constant, results in decreasing
coronary flow.  induction of hy-
pothermia when maintaining a constant bypass pressure
results in an increasing
coronary flow with temperatures down to 22 c.
further cooling causes a reduction
in flow.  using isolated coronary perfusion at 100 mm. hg,
coronary flow fell and
resistance rose during the first 15 min. of bypass.
using isolated coronary perfu-
sion at 100 mm. hg, induction of moderate hypothermia
(25 c.) caused an increase
in coronary flow and venous saturation and a decrease
in cardiovascular resistance
and mvo2.  under the same conditions, induction of
hypothermia to 18 c. produced
similar changes but caused myocardial hemorrhage
and ventricular fibrillation.  pro-
found hypothermia probably leads to excessive
fragility of the capillary bed.  reduc-
tion of perfusion pressure to 50 mm. hg at near
normothermia reduced coronary
flow and slightly reduced venous saturation
and mvo2.  the same reduction of perfu-
sion pressure at 18 c. produced similar but
less marked changes.  reduction to 25
mm. hg at 18 c. markedly reduced coronary flow,
venous saturation, and mvo2
initially, but with partial recovery later.  from this
data of acute experiments in
dogs, coronary perfusion using moderate hypothermia
(about 31 c.) and 50 mm.
hg, slightly pulsatile mean pressure appears optimal.

974. extracorporeal hypothermia without thoracotomy.  an ex-
perimental study in the use of cold for neurosurgery and
cancericidal perfusions
this paper includes minor clinical notes
on open heart surgery and cancer perfusion
but contains no experimental information
on neurosurgery or cancer perfusions.  a
method of closed-chest hypothermic perfusion
in 30 dogs is reported.  the authors
utilize drainage of superior and inferior cavae
by gravity.  the volume of venous
drainage sometimes enhanced by transfusions
or 12.5% low molecular weight dex-
tran determined the flow rate.  cooling was
maintained for quite variable periods
apparently generally to an unspecified
esophageal temperature.  perfusion time va-
ried from 30 min. to 4 hr.  animals with
low flows were perfused longer, had a high-
er incidence of ventricular fibrillation,
and a very low survival rate.  eleven ani-
mals survived.  all had pre-cooling flow
rates above 40 ml./kg./min., good flow
rates during the perfusion, and only 3 had
ventricular fibrillation.  flow rates and
survival were increased in animals receiving
low molecular weight dextran.  four-
teen of 15 animals with ventricular fibrillation
were defibrillated electrically, 8 re-
gained 'adequate' cardiac function, but only 3
survived.  some interesting data on
regional cooling of the lower half of the body
is presented.  the authors conclude
without sufficient evidence that the most
important factor in the mortality in hypo-
thermic perfusion is the ability to maintain
'a flow rate approaching the estimated
normothermic cardiac output of the animal'

2406. profound hypothermia
the aim of hypothermia is protection of vital
cerebral structures from hypoxia
during aneurysm repair; profound hypothermia
is also valuable in operating on
certain cardiac defects which cannot be repaired
even with whole body perfusion.
since the time needed for aneurysm repair often
exceeded the safe limit of 8 to 12
minutes without circulation afforded by surface
hypothermia of 29  to 30  c., the
authors have investigated the drew (open-chest)
technic, the closed-chest method,
and isolated cerebral perfusion.  the drew technic
consists of substituting two
pumps for the heart while the patient's lungs act
as the oxygenator.  because of its
disadvantages (the large amounts of blood needed
and the morbidity due to intra-
cardiac cannulation and median sternotomy), a
closed-chest method was developed,
using a mayo-gibbons vertical-sheet pump-oxygenator
to provide the perfusion and
extracorporeal cooling without requiring thoracotomy.
in cerebral perfusion, blood
is taken from one artery, pumped through a heat
exchanger, and returned to another
artery.  the authors describe anesthetic technics,
offer comparisons of the three
methods, give instructions pertaining to the production
of hypothermia, and list the
problems encountered in the management of these cases.

3194. systemic hypothermia via gastric cooling
eight dogs underwent gastric cooling for
systemic hypothermia.  each dog was cooled
with the balloon filled with a 'safe' volume
based on weight (20 ml/kg) and subjected
to cooling with the balloon filled maximally,
but safely to a pressure of 10 mm hg.
consistently, the latter procedure was far
more efficient, averaging 2.6 times as
rapid for all degrees of hypothermia.  a
decrease in core temperature by 7 c re-
quired an average of only 28.4 minutes.
on comparison with clinical reports of hy-
pothermia induced by the usual gastric
cooling, an improved efficiency of two-fold
to three-fold is still noted.

3820. the dubious haemopoietic
stem cell function of the lym-
phoid cells of the blood.
autoradiographic studies on
dogs
the migration, fate and turnover of
lymphoid cells in blood and bone marrow of
irradiated and non-irradiated dogs were
studied by serial autoradiography with co-
ping of the hind legs during the plasma
clearance time of h3-thymidine injected into
an anterior vein.  in irradiated dogs,
the h3-thymidine injection procedure was car-
ried out during the early recovery phase
following 250 r whole body x-irradiation.
conclusive evidence of transformation of
hematogenous bone marrow lymphoid cells
into hemopoietic precursors was not found.
however, in the light of the individual
grain counts transformation of a few lymphoid
cells into hemopoietic cells cannot be
ruled out.  the data obtained from a dog in the
very early recovery phase following
whole body irradiation strongly indicate such
a transformation.

3927. studies on growth and cytomorphosis
in the thymo-lympha-
tic systems - with special
reference to the influence of
the thymus and the thyroid
in guinea-pigs
migratory streams of lymphocytes between
different parts of the thymo-lymphatic
system were evaluated by comparisons between
lymphocyte populations in thoracic-
duct lymph and arterial and venous blood,
especially thymic venous blood.  by re-
cording organ weights in sham-operated and
thymectomized guinea-pigs, treated
with thyroxin or untreated, the importance
of the thymus and the thyroid for growth
and regeneration in the thymo-lymphatic
system was studied.  the main results are
as follows.  there is a considerable venous
output of lymphocytes with low mito-
chondrial content (small lymphocytes) from
the thymus in normal young guinea-pigs.
this explains the much higher incidence of
small lymphocytes in blood than in tho-
racic-duct lymph.  neonatal thymectomy
causes lymphatic hypotrophy with defi-
ciency of lymphocytes and pyroninophilic
cells in relation to reticular ones.  body
growth and survival of the animals are not
affected.  in the thymus, exogenous
thyroxin most probably promotes differentiation
of large basophilic cells to small
lymphocytes, resulting in an increased output of
small lymphocytes.  in the lymph
nodes, thyroxin promotes differentiation of large
pyroninophilic cells ('transitional
cells') into immature and mature plasma cells.
the effects of thyroxin on dif-
ferentiation are followed by an increased growth
of the thymo-lymphatic organs,
characterized by an increased incidence of large
basophilic cells and increased weight
of the lymphatic organs.  growth of the thymus and
lymph nodes precedes that of
the red splenic pulp.  this delayed splenic response
is not due to a transformation
of an increased number of immigrated thymic
lymphocytes, as neonatal thymectomy
does not prevent the thyroxin-stimulated
occurrence of large basophilic cells in the
red splenic pulp.  the thyroxin-stimulated
growth of the lymphatic system is ac-
companied by an increased output of larger
lymphocytes through the thoracic
duct, resulting in an increased number of
larger lymphocytes in the blood.  in
postnatally thymectomized animals, having a
normal (or above normal) amount of
circulating small lymphocytes, thyroxin produces
a drastic decrease in the number of
small blood lymphocytes, indicating a decreased
delivery and/or increased disappear-
ance of these cells to and from the blood, respectively.
this decrease in number of small
lymphocytes is not seen in sham-operated animals.
as judged by studies of organ
weights, the thyroxin-stimulated growth and
regeneration of the lymphatic tissue
are influenced antagonistically by thymectomy
and synergistically by local factors
in involuted tissue.

815. the origin of macrophages
from bone marrow in the rat
skin windows' and subcutaneous coverslips
were applied to rats in a study designed
to identify the tissues in which the precursors
of macrophages proliferate.  lympho-
cyte-depletion by either chronic drainage from
the thoracic duct or 400 rads of x-
irradiation failed to suppress the emigration of
macrophages or to reduce the pro-
portion of them which became labelled after an
injection of tritiated thymidine.  x-
irradiation with 750 rads suppressed
the emigration and the labelling of the exudate
macrophages.  both were restored to
normal when the tibial marrow was shielded
during irradiation.  radioactively-labelled
cell suspensions obtained from thoracic
duct lymph, lymph nodes, thymus, spleen
and bone marrow were transfused into
syngeneic recipients.  the emigration of
labelled macrophages on to coverslips
could be demonstrated only in recipients
of labelled bone marrow and spleen cells.
labelled monocytes were found in the blood
of rats which had received injections
of labelled bone marrow.  it was concluded
that in the rat, bone marrow, and to a
lesser extent spleen, are major sources of
the macrophages which emigrate into
foci of acute, non-bacterial inflammation.

1786. studies of the
leucocyte compartment
in guinea-pig bone
marrow after acute
haemorrhage and
severe hypoxia  evidence
for a common stem-cell
after a large acute hemorrhage,
the absolute le-
vels of neutrophils, eosinophils, and
basophils in guinea
pig bone marrow are considerably
reduced.  all stages
of differentiation are involved, the
decline in myelo-
blasts and promyelocytes being
particularly marked.
exposure to severe hypoxia also
temporarily depresses
the number of marrow granulocytes.
bone marrow
lymphocytes are only slightly reduced
after a single he-
morrhage but in the later stages of
severe hypoxia their
numbers are greatly reduced.
assuming the supply of
stem cells in the bone marrow
is not unlimited, the de-
crease in marrow granulocytes
and lymphocytes follow-
ing marked erythropoietic stimulation
appears to favor
a monophyletic theory of hemopoiesis;
a heavy demand
for stem cells to differentiate into the
erythron may
temporarily restrict the
number entering the leukon.  the
hypoxic animals showed
a considerable loss of body weight
and the notable reduction
of marrow lymphocytes in the
later stages of hypoxia
may be specifically related to a
generalized atrophy of
lymphoid tissue.  using h3-thymi-
dine there is evidence
of active dna synthesis in guinea
pig metamyelocytes.
although dna-synthesis was found
in metamyelocytes of
normal marrow, after hemorrhage
these cells form a much
larger proportion of the total
synthesizing cells in the
granulocyte compartment and
also the ratio of labeled
metamyelocytes to myelocytes
is considerably increased.
microspectrophotometric
measurements of the feulgen
dna-content of metamyelo-
cytes after hemorrhage show
that there are 2 populations
of these cells.  one group has
values typical of resting or
nonsynthesizing cells but a 2nd
group shows a complete
range of dna-values up to levels
characteristic of those
found in dividing cells.  certain
small mononuclear cells
with minimal but deeply basophilic
cytoplasm are a dis-
tinctive group of dna-synthesizing
cells in marrow af-
ter hemorrhage.  morphologically,
there appears to be a
complete sequence between these
cells and procrythro-
blasts.

marrow to repopulate lethal-
ly irradiated f1 hybrids
lethally irradiate (c57bl x 101)f1 mice
injected with a mixture of 10 million
c57bl and 10 million 101 bone-marrow
cells were repopulated only by the 101
bone-marrow cells.  experiments with other
cell mixtures indicated that the 101
marrow was relatively nine times as efficient
as c57bl marrow in repopulating
lethally irradiated (c57bl x 101)f1 mice.
results from additional strain combina-
tions suggested that the behavior of the
donor marrows was not determined solely
by h-2 factors.  c57bl marrow, which
frequently regresses in irradiated f1 mice,
has shown to be relatively less capable
of repopulating the recipient than regularly
retained parental marrow.  the differences
in the relative abilities of parental mar-
rows to repopulate f1 mice cannot as yet be
fully explained.  they might be corre-
lated with physiological differences between
the parental marrows or with a micro-
environmental advantage of one hematopoietic
cell type over another in the irradiated
recipient.  immunological and physiological factors
that might favor this selective
growth are discussed.

'lymphocyte'
bone marrow from normal and polycythemic
mice was filtered through glass wool
columns to remove cells other than 'lymphocytes'.
for a given number of nucleated
cells, filtered marrow was more efficient than
the original marrow in repopulating
the spleen of an isogenic recipient previously
exposed to lethal irradiation.  the
proliferative capacity of both the filtered and
unfiltered marrow suspensions ap-
peared to be a constant function of the number
of small and medium 'lymphocytes'
present and not of any other cell type.

2045. the effect of
unilateral limb shield-
ing on the haemopoietic
response of the
guinea-pig to gamma
irradiation
guineapigs were exposed to
150 r  -irradiation
whilst approx. 1/5 of the total bone
marrow was protect-
ed by shielding 2 limbs.  quantitative
cell counts of both
the shielded and irradiated marrow
were combined with
observations on the thymus, spleen
and blood during the
recovery period, and compared
with the effects of whole-
body irradiation.  following
whole-body irradiation
(150 r) the thymus shows a
delayed secondary cellular
depletion coinciding with a
marked splenic hyperplasia.
both phenomena were eliminated
by limb shielding.  the
lymphocytes in the irradiated
marrow of partially shiel-
ded animals continued to show
both the overshoot and the
secondary fall in numbers which
characterize recovery
from whole-body irradiation
(150 r).  after an initial fall
in numbers of erythroid and
granulocytic precursors,
the shielded marrow showed
a temporary increase in
granulocytopoiesis coinciding
with an abortive phase of
granulocytopoiesis in the irradiated
marrow.  there was
no evidence of any effective colonization
of irradiated
marrow by cells from the shielded marrow.
the signi-
ficance of these findings is discussed.

transfused thymus cells
and lymphnode cells on the bone
marrow
in rabbits transfused with thymus cells and
lymphnode cells the peripheral blood and
bone marrow were studied.  the transfusion
of thymus cells caused a peripheral
lymphocytosis and a diminution of lymphoid
cells in the bone marrow of both young
and adult rabbits.  the transfusion of lymphnode
cells resulted in a peripheral lympho-
penia, and an initial increase and a subsequent
diminution of lymphoid cells in the
bone marrow.  it is suggested that lymphoid cells
in the bone marrow may be lympho-
cytes which are stored or discharged according
to a variety of conditions.  further-
more, thymus cells are thought to mobilize
lymphocytes from the bone marrow to
the peripheral blood.

differential response of the
bone marrow to primary and
secondary hypoxia
twenty-five adult male guinea pigs were
placed in a decompression chamber, at a
simulated altitude of 14,000 feet for 5 days,
then kept in ordinary air for 5 days,
and finally returned to the decompression
chamber to be subjected to hypoxia a
second time, for periods ranging from 1
to 5 days.  during this period of secondary
hypoxia quantitative studies were made
of the changes in the blood and bone marrow.
in secondary as in primary hypoxia there
is a significant increase in the nucleated
red cells of the marrow.  in secondary
hypoxia, however, there is a very marked
increase in the marrow lymphocytes,
whereas in primary hypoxia the lymphocytes
fall.  the marrow reticulocytes remain
at a fairly constant level despite marked
fluctuations in erythropoiesis.

1044. an investigation of lymphocyte
production in guinea-pig
bone marrow
evidence from a variety of experiments indicates
that lymphocytes are produced in
guinea-pig bone marrow.  under certain conditions
the numbers produced appear to
be considerable.  during recovery from irradiation
there are numerous telophases
in marrow smears which appear to be forming small
lymphocytes.  moreover, many
lymphocytes are still found in shielded bone marrow
after the rest of the body, in-
cluding the conventional lymphoid tissues, has
received lethal or supra-lethal irra-
diation.  almost 50% of these cells are formed
after the irradiation.  finally, when
bone marrow is cultured in the peritoneal cavity
of a host whose own lymphocyte
production has been suppressed by irradiation,
small percentages of newly-formed
small lymphocytes are found in this marrow.

103. repopulation of bone marrow
in mice  number and type of
cells required for
post-x-irradiation protection
fractionation of cells from mouse bone
marrow and autologous mouse spleen indi-
cates that the cell responsible for bone
marrow repopulation and x-irradiation
protection resembles the small lymphocyte.
experiments with injection of different
numbers of bone marrow and spleen cells
and observations on survival obtained by
fractional irradiation of the entire body and
of extirpation of the shielded spleen
after irradiation indicate that approximately
3 x 10 4 cells of this type are required
to provide 50% survival, and that approximately
this number migrates from the
shielded extremity or spleen of a mouse per hour
(slightly faster for spleen and slower for bone marrow).

104. hyperbasophilic cells as an
indication of proliferation of
bone marrow transplanted to
irradiated dogs
a study was made of hyperbasophilic cells
which appeared following transplantation
of bone marrow to 20 irradiated mongrel
dogs of both sexes.  in the main series of
experiments the animals were irradiated
with a dosage of 600 r., using a four-tube
rum-3 x-ray machine  voltage 200 kv,
current 10 ma, filters 0.5 cu mm + 1.0
mm.al, target distance 60 cm., rate
18-22 r./min.  at 1-2 days after irradiation,
a suspension of bone marrow cells in a
dosage of 10 9 - 5 x 10 9 nuclear cells was
administered i.v.  the marrow was
obtained by aspiration from various skeletal
bones or by compression from the
sternum, ribs and other bones.  a study was made
of the morphological composition
of the blood and bone marrow before irradiation
and at 1-5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30
days after irradiation and transfusion of bone mar-
row, and thereafter at 10-15 days
intervals.  smears of blood and marrow were
stained with azure-ii-eosin.  it was
found that distinctive cells with basophilic proto-
plasm and frequent incidence of an
immature nucleus were present in the blood of
dogs following irradiation with 600 r.
and transplantation of bone marrow.  hyper-
basophilic cells appeared in the blood
at 2 - 4 days after transplantation and attained
a maximum 14 - 21 days later; thereafter
their number diminished rapidly.  the
trend of number of hyperbasophilic cells
coincided with that of other donor elements
(leukocytes, erythrocytes).  hyperbasophilic
cells were not found during acute radia-
tion sickness in dogs which were not given
injections of bone marrow.  they were
found 3 mth. after transplantation of bone
marrow to nonirradiated puppies at 2-3
days of age.  when the irradiation dosage
was increased to 800-1,000 r., the number
of hyperbasophilic cells increased and
attained a peak sooner than after the 600 r.
dosage.  such cells were formed from
the donor cells.

of 4 irradiated and 4 non-

by serial autoradiography
with clamping of the hind legs
during the plasma clear-
ance time of h3-thymidine
injected into an anterior

h3-thymidine injection pro-
cedure was carried out during
the early recovery phase

x-irradiation.  the results on
2 irradiated and 2 normal
dogs were described in de-
tail.  migration of lymphoid
cells from blood to marrow
parenchyma was confirmed
in the irradiated dogs.  con-
clusive evidence of transformation
of these cells into
hemopoietic precursors was not
found.  the relative
number of large lymphoid cells,
the labeling index of
the whole population of lymphoid
cells, and that of small
lymphoid cells were increased
in irradiated marrow;
few initially labeled small
lymphoid cells could also be
observed.  these data indicate
that the pattern of pro-
liferation of lymphoid cells is
changed in irradiated re-
generating bone marrow.

by means of an indirect

peripheral blood and bone marrow

dence is presented that monocytes,
as well as mature
neutrophils and their precursors
extending back to the
progranulocyte, contain significant
amounts of this en-
zyme.  a rare mature eosinophil
demonstrated a trace
of lysozyme activity.  there was
no evidence of lyso-
zyme activity in basophils,
erythrocytes, megakaryo-
cytes, platelets, plasma
cells, tissue mast cells or
bone marrow
reticuloendothelial cells.

1770. proliferative activity of the
lymphatic tissues of rats as
studied with tritium-labelled
thymidine
cytokinetic data are presented, employing
quantitation of h3dna in the lymphatic
tissues of normal rats serially sacrificed
after h3tdr administration.  a marked
difference in the patterns of initial labeling
and label loss was observed between the
thymus and peripheral lymphatic tissue.
the data are compatible with other indica-
tions of rapid cell renewal in the thymus.
there is suppression of initial uptake of
h3tdr into the dna of each large lymphocytic
progenitor cell in the thymus, appa-
rently because of a feedback of thymidine
containing material from small lympho-
cytes in the thymus.  depletion of the thymus
of small cells, as by operative stress
or whole body x-ray, leads to a marked
increase in the uptake of h3tdr into the
dna of large thymocytes.  this finding,
which is in agreement with the previous
findings of sugino et al. suggesting transfer
of thymine nucleotides from small thy-
mus lymphocytes to precursor cells, may or
may not be related to the apparent
transfer of dna label between thymic cells.
the evidence for the latter consists of
the curvilinear dilution of the dna label in
the thymus proliferating cell population
and the relationship between the rate of dna
label dilution in large cells and the
dna in the small cells in the thymus.  after
the dna label in progenitor cells in
the thymus and lymph nodes has entered the
small cell population, the subsequent
dilution of grains in these dividing cells follows
the same slope as the loss of radio-
activity from the entire lymph node.  there is a
long retention of some h3dna label
in the dividing lymph node cell population.  this
suggests that the loss of radioacti-
vity from the dividing cells and from the small
cell population as a whole occurs e-
qually.  this pattern prevails regardless of
whether the percentage of large and
small cells is altered experimentally.  these
findings can be explained by an inter-
change of the dna nuclear label between small
lymphocytes and large lymphocytes.
this could occur by some process such as
phagocytosis or pinocytosis, or by trans-
formation of the small lymphocyte into a large,
dividing cell.  the data fit best with
the latter possibility.  all or any of these
mechanisms would lead to an equilibration
of the dna label between large and small
cells.  this finding prevents the assign-
ment of a finite life span to lymphocytes on
the basis of dna labeling kinetics.  ne-
vertheless, there appear to be at least two
different types of lymphocytes.  one,
the 'thymus-type' lymphocyte, is found in the
thymus cortex, bone marrow and ger-
minal centers of lymphoid follicles.  the other
type, found abundantly in the wide-
spread peripheral lymphatic tissue, shows a
very prolonged retention of dna la-
bel and is believed to be recirculating,
'immunologically committed' cells described
by others.  these cells do not appear to
enter the thymus cortex.

17-hydroxy-corticosteroids in the
plasma of patients with cancer of the
breast on i.v. infusion of acth
seventeen patients with advanced mammary
cancer were given an infusion with
3 u. of acth in 5 hr. and 6 others an infusion
of 25 u.  determinations were made
of the plasma 17-hydroxy-corticosteroids,
free and bound to glucuronic acid both
before and after the infusion.  in rapidly
growing carcinomas, high initial values
were found for the free corticosteroids
(more than 20 ug./100 ml. of plasma).
the ratio of free to bound corticosteroids is
for stage iv patients 1.8 on the average,
and approximately 1 for the mixed
forms stage iv + m.  these ratios are not
altered by acth.  shifts in the ratio
of free to bound corticosteroids with acth
treatment can be seen, depending on
the initial value of the free corticosteroids.
the administration of 3 u. is enough
and the 5 hr. value is some 70%, related to a
maximal stimulation with 25 u.

4179. reduced estriol excretion in patients
with breast cancer prior to endocrine
therapy
the urinary quotient of estriol/estrone +
estradiol-17b(eq) was measured chemically in
women with and without breast cancer, as an in-
dex of the ratio of noncarcinogenic impeded es-
trogens to mammary carcinogenic estrogens.  in
34 controls, the median eq was 1.3 before and 1.2
after menopause, with only 21% of the patients sub-
normal.  in 26 breast cancer patients without endo-
crine treatment or recent surgery, the median eq
was 0.5 and 0.8 respectively, with 62% of the pa-
tients subnormal.  after major surgery or hormo-
nal therapy, only 23% of 53 patients were subnor-
mal, no remissions being observed unless the eq
rose toward normal.  matching of 24 controls and
patients in pairs by age and ovarian status in the
wilcoxon test indicated that the decreased eq ex-
creted in untreated cancer was significant at the
0.2% confidence level.  the marked increase in eq
induced by castration and androgen, estrogen, and
corticosteroid therapy suggests that normaliza-
tion of a precancerous metabolic imbalance be-
tween impeded and active estrogens derived from
ovarian and adrenocortical sources contributed to
arrested growth of estradiol-dependent metastases.

cantly higher percentage as estriol than
women in the premenopausal control group.
there was no significant difference in the
excretion of total estrogen between cancer
groups and controls in good health.
postmenopausal patients with cancer excreted
higher levels of estriol than postmenopausal
control groups.  the increase in estriol
excretion cannot be explained by debilitation.

5323. systemic effects of androgenic
and estrogenic hormones in advanced
breast cancer
the systemic effects of diethylstilbestrol
(45 patients), testosterone propionate
(48 patients), and both hormones (22 patients)
were studied during the treatment
(six weeks to over three months) of advanced
breast cancer in postmenopausal
women.  serious complications included
induced hypercalcemia and fluid re-
tention.  physiologic effects such as
urinary incontinence (diethylstilbestrol),
virilization (testosterone), or nausea and
vomiting did not necessitate disconti-
nuance of treatment.  androgenic therapy
stimulated erythropoiesis.  observa-
tions on the systemic reactions to these
hormonal agents definitely contribute to
the evaluation of sex steroid therapy.

3478. the effect of dehydroepiandrosterone
on the 17-hydroxycorti-
costeroids in the plasma in various stages
of cancer and other diseases of
the breast
the reducing effect of dehydroepiandrosterone
on the plasma corticosteroids is
on the average shortened in advanced
(stage iv) cases of breast cancer.  in 3
groups of patients, the lowest corticosteroid
levels were found up to 6 hr. after
infusion of dehydroepiandrosterone-phosphate.
in patients with mastopathy the
effect was still detectable 12 hr. later; in patients
with breast cancer in stage iv the
initial levels were reached at that time.  in
cases with stages i and ii lesions, the
findings were intermediate.  the shortening
is attributed to a more intensive
transformation of dehydroepiandrosterone in
advanced cases of breast cancer.

5274. urinary excretion of estrone,
estradiol and estriol by patients with
prostatic cancer and benign prostatic
hypertrophy
and hopkins c.e.
urinary estrone, estradiol, and estriol
fractions excreted by 21 patients with
prostatic cancer, 17 patients with benign
hypertrophy, and 59 clinically well
subjects were assayed to determine whether
differences exist.  absolute levels of
estrone, estradiol, and estriol fractions were
not significantly different.  the
excretion of relatively lower levels of estrone
and estradiol, and relatively higher
levels of estriol by patients with prostatic
cancer compared to clinically well
subjects resulted in significantly lower
proportions of the total estrogen being
excreted as estrone and estradiol.  differences in
the proportions of estrogen frac-
tions between patients with benign hypertrophy
and clinically well subjects were
not significant.  with the exception of a significantly
higher percentage of the total
estrogen being excreted as estrone by the patients
with benign hypertrophy,
differences between that group and the cancer
group were also not significant.
clinical variations between the 3 groups, and
within the cancer and hypertrophy
groups, preclude assignment of significant
differences to prostatic dystrophies
alone.  cancer patients experiencing inanition
due to a loss of appetite excreted
significantly lower levels of estrone than patients
who reported no loss of appetite.
significantly lower levels of estrone were excreted
by patients with benign hyper-
trophy hospitalized 6 days or more compared to
patients hospitalized 5 days or less.
a significantly higher urinary estrone-androsterone
ratio was present in the cancer
group than in the clinically well group.  it is not
believed, however, that an arbi-
trary ratio can be used to suggest an internal
estrogen-androgen imbalance.

28029 enzymic synthesis of steroid
sulfates.  ii. presence of steroid sulfo-
kinase in human mammary carcinoma
extracts
extracts of human primary and secondary
mammary carcinomas were shown to
contain steroid sulfokinase(s) in every case
examined.  examination of normal
breast tissue surrounding the tumors revealed
very weak steroid sulfokinase
activity in some instances.  this was thought to
be due to the fibrous nature and
poor cellularity of the normal breast tissue.
normal ovarian tissue specimens,
obtained from cancer patients undergoing
oophorectomy, did not generally
contain the enzyme, but trace levels were detected
in 1 of 5 specimens examined.
steroids, without necessarily showing conversion
to steroid sulfate, were observed
to increase the incorporation of s35-sulfate into
one of the products formed enzy-
mically on incubating breast tissue extracts
with s35-adenosine-3'-phosphate-5'-
phosphosulfate.

3752. steroid excretion in early breast cancer
patients with advanced breast cancer
who subsequently fail to respond to adrenalec-
tomy or hypophysectomy have been
found to excrete abnormal amounts of the
urinary metabolites of androgen and
cortisol.  when similar measurements are
carried out on patients with early breast
cancer, it is found that approximately half
the cases presenting for mastectomy are
also excreting abnormal amounts of these
steroids.  subsequent follow-up shows that
these cases tend to have a poor progno-
sis, and a trial had therefore been started
in which the abnormality is being cor-
rected.  in addition, it seems possible that
the deficiency in adrogen excretion may
precede the onset of the disease.  this
problem is being investigated in a trial
involving urinary steroid estimations in
5000 normal women.  the measurements
are being compared with the subsequent
development of breast cancer.

2365. the excretion of oestrone, pregnanediol
and pregnanetriol in breast
cancer patients.  i. excretion after spontaneous
menopause
the urinary excretion of oestrone, pregnanediol and
pregnanetriol was determined
in a series of postmenopausal breast cancer patients
receiving no endocrine treat-
ment.  the steroid excretion was studied
both in relation to the age of the patients
as well as in relation to the time elapsed
since the last menstrual cycle.  the results
indicate that after an initial slow decrease
from the age of the menopause onward,
the excretion of oestrone and preganediol
increases again.  a new maximum was
found in the group 10-15 yr. after the
menopause.  the excretion of pregnanetriol
however, remains relatively constant
after a more rapid fall during the first few
years after the menopause.

2366. the excretion of oestrone,
pregnanediol and pregnanetriol in breast
cancer patients.  ii. effect of ovariectomy,
ovarian irradiation and corticos-
teroids.
the urinary excretion of oestrone,
pregnanediol and pregnanetriol was determined
in breast cancer patients at different
stages of their endocrine treatment.  the
results demonstrate that corticosteroids
in substitution doses (cortisone 50 mg. daily
or prednisone 10 mg. daily, divided in 4
daily doses) are very effective in depressing
the excretion of all 3 steroids in postmenopausal
patients.  this is in agreement with
the clinical impression that these easily tolerated
small doses of corticosteroids have
the same therapeutic effect as adrenalectomy in
patients with breast cancer.  the
results indicate that the ovaries may contribute
to the production of oestrogens for
many years after the menopause, and that this
production is depressed by ovarian
irradiation.  this is in agreement with the clinical
observation that ovarian irra-
diation has a therapeutic value in postmenopausal
women with breast cancer.

17-ketosteroids in the diagnosis of car-
cinoma of the prostate
in 33 patients with histologically
confirmed carcinoma and in 37 patients with
confirmed benign hyperplasia of the
prostate the amount of neutral 17-ketosteroids
was estimated in 24-hr. samples of
urine.  the results revealed that, contrary to
reports in the literature, this diagnostic
method is quite unreliable.  raised
17-ketosteroid levels were found also in
a high percentage of control subjects.
moreover, the estimation of 17-ketosteroids
is a very laborious biochemical
method and involves a relatively great
experimental error.

2820. influence of small doses of corticosteroids
on the excretion of pregnanetriol and oestrone
in a series of patients with breast cancer
excretion of oestrone and pregnanetriol
was determined.  with administration of
corticosteroids oestrone excretion in
postmenopausal women diminished   67%.
a decrease of pregnanetriol ex-
cretion values was observed as well.  evidently
a low oestrone excretion in patients
subjected to corticosteroid therapy is due to a
depression of the adrenal function.

in british and japanese women with

japanese women excrete more andosterene

than do british women living in tokyo.  the
mean 5a/5b ratio in the former is 1.3
and in the latter 1.0, and these means differ
significantly.  the ratio is markedly
affected by thyroid function, and thyroid
disease has been reported to affect the
incidence of breast cancer which in japan is
only one eighth of that in white women
in north america or great britain.

in 100 women in the menopause with breast cancer
the mean level of plasma 17-
ketosteroids (17-ks) and 17-hydroxycorticosteroids
(17-ohcs) was significantly
higher than in normal women of equivalent age.
in 67 young women only the
level of the plasma 17-ohcs was significantly higher
than normal.  in menopausal
women with breast cancer whether treated or not
there is no correlation between
the level of the plasma 17-ks and that of 17-ohcs.

urinary porter-silber chromogens have been
measured in 2 groups of patients
with breast cancer before, during and after
intravenous methopyrapone and
acth administration.  the control group
consisted of females free of disease
5 years or more following mastectomy while
the study group had documented
metastatic disease.  no significant difference in
the urinary porter-silber chromo-
gens was found between the 2 groups on any day
during the course of the study and
were within the range of normal as measured
in this laboratory.  it is concluded
that the functional reserve capacity for both
pituitary acth secretion and adreno-
cortical steroidogenesis in patients with
advanced metastatic breast cancer is rela-
tively normal.

2349. amyloidosis in the autopsy material of the pathology department of
tuberculosis institute, warsaw, in 1945-1962
the autopsy material of the pathology
department of the tuberculosis institute, in
1945-1962, included 1218 postmortem
examinations of patients who died from tuberculo-
sis.  in 111 cases tuberculosis was
complicated by amyloidosis.  in 1945-1957 amy-
loidosis accounted for 8.7% of the cases;
in 1958-1962 this percentage was 10.8.
there was no difference in the incidence
between men and women, the only difference
between the two sexes was that the peak
tuberculosis fatality curve in men was in
the 40-60 years age group, and that of
amyloidosis at the 20-30 age group, while in
women the greatest number of death from
tuberculosis was in the 20-30 age group,
and from amyloidosis in the 30-40 age group.

766. certain features of the haemogram in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis
complicated by amyloidosis (russian)
regression of amyloidosis in the early stages
seems possible and for this reason
russian clinicians are exploring the possibilities
of finding means of early diagnosis
of this complication.  the author studied 300
complete clinical blood analyses made
in 60 patients, viz. 30 with chronic fibrocavernous
and cirrhotic forms of tb com-
plicated by amyloidosis and 30 with the same forms
of tb without amyloidosis.  from
detailed serial study of the haemogram in patients
with pulmonary tb it is possible
to diagnose associated amyloidosis of the internal
organs in its initial stage.  the
presence of amyloidosis of the internal organs can
be inferred from the following
changes in the blood picture  (a) the appearance of
normochromic and hypochromic
anaemia in patients with various forms of tb (with
the exception of tb of the kidneys,
intestinal tract or larynx, and of caseous lymph
nodes), (b) progressive increase
in the leucocyte count with a neutrophil shift to
the left not corresponding with a
phase of quiescence of the main disease, (c) consistently
high esr in the absence
of an active process, (d) thrombocytosis in the phase of
subsidence of a flare-up,
and also changes in the thrombocytic formula tending
towards the appearance of de-
generative forms and old and mature thrombocytes.

a patient with diffuse tracheo-bronchial
amyloidosis is described; brief clinical
details supplement those published in a
previous report (prowse,1958) and are
followed by an account of the necropsy
findings and the histological appearances
at the site of amyloid deposition.  the
literature is reviewed and arguments are
advanced in favour of a common aetiology
for amyloidosis in all its forms.  if this
acts through the immunity mechanism, it is
suggested that variations in the site,
strength, duration, and frequency of the
antigen stimulus and the antibody response
may determine the nature and distribution
of the amyloid deposits.

2091. modern methods of treatment of visceral amyloidosis in patients with
pulmonary tuberculosis (russian)
the immediate and long-term results of
treatment during 1945-1962 of 414 patients
with pulmonary tuberculosis complicated
by amyloidosis were studied.  hormonal
(corticosteroid) therapy is the pathogenetic
treatment for visceral amyloidosis and
is indicated in the proteinuric and early
edema-hypotonic phase of amyloidosis when
the functional capacity of the kidneys and
the liver is still adequate.  in the azotemic
phase of amyloidosis, hormonal (corticosteroid)
therapy is not indicated, since it
leads to rapid deterioration in the patient's
condition.  since hypoxemia is one of the
main factors in the pathogenesis of amyloidosis,
oxygen therapy is rational patho-
genetic therapy for patients with pulmonary
tuberculosis complicated by hypoxemia
and with symptoms of the proteinuric or
edema-hypotonic phase of amyloidosis
(without ascites), in the form of
subcutaneous introduction of oxygen or oxy-
geno-peritoneum.  in patients with
pulmonary tuberculosis surgical interven-
tion on account of the main process
is indicated only in the early stages of amyloi-
dosis when pronounced functional
disorders of the kidneys and liver are absent.  co-
joint therapy using protein vitamins
(particularly ascorbic acid), hormonal (corticos-
teroid) preparations, oxygen and
desensitizing agents and elimination of all foci of
infection is indicated in treatment
of pulmonary tuberculosis with even the earliest
signs of amyloidosis.

2317. the use of needle biopsy of the liver in the diagnosis of visceral
amyloidosis in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (russian)
the results of 86 puncture biopsies of the
liver in 84 patients with pulmonary tuber-
culosis (55 men and 31 women aged from
18 to 73 yr.) for the purpose of diagnosing
amyloidosis are reported.  puncture was
performed when amyloidosis was suspected
on the basis of the case history (destructive
process of more than 2-3 years' duration),
clinical signs in the form of enlargement of
the liver and spleen, edema, changes
in the blood picture and blood protein formula,
and changes in the urine (proteinuria,
cylindruria, isohyposthenuria).  amyloidosis
was diagnosed or its presence surmised
before puncture in 23 patients; the puncture
biopsy confirmed the diagnosis in 14
and refuted it in 9 of them.  in 8 patients without
clinical symptoms, amyloidosis
was diagnosed on the basis of the puncture biopsy
alone.  in 9 cases with fatal out-
come, the post-mortem findings coincided with
the results of the bioptic puncture.
of the 62 patients in whom amyloidosis was not
detected by biopsy, 31 had moderate
dystrophic changes and 9 had marked dystrophic
changes while in 22 cases no patho-
logical changes were found; 6 of these patients
later developed amyloidosis.  these
findings supported the contention that liver
amyloidosis is linked with dystrophic
changes in the epithelial cells.  marked
dystrophic changes can precede amyloidosis
or may occur simultaneously with it.  moderate
dystrophic changes are quite common
in patients with an exacerbating tuberculous
process in the lungs.  the wide applica-
tion of bioptic puncture of the liver in indicated
cases can increase our knowledge
of the morphological changes taking place in the
liver in tb.

2701. the role of certain additional factors in the development of amyloidosis,
and its prophylaxis in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (russian)
in patients with chronic fibrocavernous
tuberculosis of the lungs, any toxic-aller-
gic side reactions to antibacterial therapy,
chronic foci or infection and diseases
with an allergic component can contribute
to the development of amyloidosis.  the
early detection and clearing of chronic
foci of infection and effective measures
against even mildly pronounced toxic-allergic
side reactions are of prime impor-
tance in the prevention of amyloidosis.  the
unsystematic and prolonged administra-
tion of antibacterial preparations, along with
their toxic side effects, tends to in-
crease the incidence of amyloidosis in patients
with chronic fibrocavernous pulmon-
ary tb.  individual constitutional factors are
of great importance in the development
of side effects.  side reactions to chemopreparations,
in cases of hypofunction of
the liver and kidneys and autonomic
dysfunction promote the development of dys-
trophic processes, as is confirmed
by the high frequency of toxic-allergic reac-
tions in patients with fibrocavernous
pulmonary tb who later develop amyloidosis.
the administration of desensitizing drugs
to patients showing side reactions there-
fore helps to prevent amyloidosis in cases
of chronic fibrocavernous tb, and chemo-
therapy should be automatically combined
with the administration of desensitizing
and stimulatory drugs in this class of case.

1835. the decrease of the steroids in the urine in the course of lung tb.
(the therapeutic value of their increase after calciferol)
quantitative determination of the urinary
steroids in 38 patients with extensive ul-
cero-caseous pulmonary tb confirmed
that the 17-ketosteroids are always decreased
in these cases.  calciferol, in the form
of one ampoule of vit.  d2 of 600,000 u.
every 10 days, in combination with active
tuberculostatic drugs, in the majority of
the cases leads to an increase of the
urinary 17-ketosteroids from 50 to 100% in 2
mth.  it appears that the calciferol
exerts its action through proteolysis; it stimulates
the liquefaction and evacuation of the
caseous material.  this proteolytic effect is
related to that of the mineralocorticoids,
which are phlogistic and proteolytic sub-
stances.  calciferol offers the advantage
over these substances that it does not affect
the electrolytes and is well tolerated by
the organism.  for this reason, good results
may be expected from its administration
in cases of extensive pulmonary tb, in
which the myc. tuberculosis has remained
sensitive to the administered tuberculostic
drugs but nevertheless does not proceed
towards recovery because of the marked caseous
lesions.  in such cases calciferol treatment
leads to a rapid and pronounced decrease
of the radiological shadows, improves the
general condition and also modifies the
steroid metabolism rendered abnormal by the disease.

the case is reported of a previously healthy
young north-african male, in whom
a post-primary ulcero-infiltrative tb in less
than 2 mth. led to the development of
visceral amyloidosis, which could be confirmed
by biopsies of the kidney and liver.
during treatment with antibiotics,
the hepatic amyloidosis regressed parallel with
the improvement of the tb, and the
biological signs of the renal amyloidosis dis-
appeared with the exception of a
pronounced proteinuria, the persistence of which
renders the long-term prognosis highly doubtful.

2216. the relations between lupus erythematosus and diseases of the
lympho-reticular system
a case report of a patient with led
(aged 48 years), who developed secondarily
a lymphoblastic sarcoma.  when the
sarcomatous degeneration of the lympho-
reticular system became apparent,
the serological and immuno-hematological tests,
typical for led, were negative.  to
interpret the observation, 62 further patients
with lymphogranuloma, lymphosarcoma,
leukemias, other malignant tumors, sar-
coidosis, and tuberculosis were investigated
serologically and immunohematolo-
gically.  antinuclear factors were found in
serum of 4 patients with lymphogranulo-
ma, one patient with anaplastic carcinoma,
and one patient with metastasizing
mixed parotid-tumor.  the identity of the
antinuclear antibodies with those found in
led could not be proved by different methods.
the importance of certain diseases
of the lympho-reticular system for the production
of antinuclear factors was dis-
cussed.

twelve normal subjects, 18 cases of

all patients were given a prednisolone
test, with urine culture before and after the
test, and in many instances determination
of the urinary osmolarity; the urinary
sediment was examined with the sternheimer
and malbin staining technique and
with the peroxydase stain to investigate the
urinary cytology.  with the criteria
adopted, the test was negative in the normals
and was positive in 61.1% of the cases
of chronic pyelonephritis and in 12.1% of the
remaining cases of unequivocally non-
infectious renal disease.  the increase of the
urinary bacterial count after cortico-
steroid administration, and investigation of the
various components of the urinary
sediment also supplied useful diagnostic
information.  on the contrary, the stern-
heimer-malbin stain for the urinary
sediment proved of little use.

the detailed structure of this

and some vessels contained
amyloid.  amyloid is not uncommon in the stroma
of tumors.  a summary of 17
tumoral amyloid cases reported by others is included.

7364. experimental amyloidosis in immunity
much of interest in the mechanism of
experimental amyloidosis as a result of the
parenteral introduction of foreign protein
has been centered around the nature of
the links leading to cytological and biochemical
changes in tissues and body fluids.
some of the authors suggested that such links
may be of immunological nature.
there is however, no clear-cut proof either
in favor of or against the theory of an
immunological origin of amyloid.  since
injection of proteins during the perinatal
period prevents an immune response when
the animal is subsequently challenged
with the same antigen, the authors studied
amyloidosis caused by casein in mice
treated after birth with this protein.  mice
exposed soon after birth to casein ac-
quire an immune tolerance to this antigen.
this was demonstrated by the absence
of circulating antibodies as measured by the
disappearance of i-labeled casein
from the circulation and by means of passive
hemagglutination tests with ascitic
fluids.  both tolerant and control animals
developed amyloidosis to the same extent.
the results imply that the pathogenesis of
amyloidosis does not rest upon a classic
immunological basis; they do not exclude
the possibility, that the disease may be
due to some auto-immune process.

3535. electron microscopic study of six cases of human renal amyloidosis
this study is particularly concerned
with  (a) the basal membrane in the different
stages; and (b) the intercapillary spaces
in the early stages.  the conclusions may
be put as follows  (1) the amyloid substance
seems to have a fibrillar structure
from the start.  (2) when the walls of the
peripheral capillary loops are thickened
by voluminous amyloid deposits, the
hyaline aspect of the primitive basal membrane
persists, but its structure is altered by
the presence of multiple amyloid fibrils.
(3) on the other hand, in the initial stages,
amyloid fibrils cannot be seen in the
'lamina densa' of the basal membrane; they
only appear on the epithelial and endo-
thelial surfaces of the membrane.  this suggests
that amyloidosis represents an
abnormal precipitate of extrinsic origin, rather
than a transformation 'in situ'
of the basal membrane.  (4) in the very early stages
of amyloid infiltration into the
glomeruli the fibrillar substance is found first in
the intercapillary spaces, only
later does it reach the peripheral capillary walls.

3544. morphology and development of infectious-toxic affections of the kidneys
in pulmonary tuberculosis (russian)
the kidneys of 75 patients dead from tb of
the lungs and of 30 rabbits with pulmonary
tb were examined.  the first lesions develop
in the glomeruli, followed by changes
in the stroma and tubules.  infectious-toxic
affection of the kidneys is a complex and
prolonged process involving organic immune
reactions, lymphostasis, venous stasis
and finally nephrosclerosis.  infectious-toxic
lesions were found in one third of the patients
who died of pulmonary tb.  these changes had
produced clinical manifestations, on the
basis of which the following affections had been
diagnosed  nephritis, nephrosis, amyloi-
dosis.  antibacterial therapy of the pulmonary
process reduced the renal lesions.  how-
ever, severe infectious-toxic affection of the kidneys
may develop after recovery from
pulmonary tb.

3553. diffuse nodular amyloidosis of the lungs
in a 59-year-old man, who 12 yr. previously
had ceased working in an aluminium
factory and who had died from respiratory
insufficiency, the postmortem examination
revealed disseminated nodules in the lungs.
the nodules were sharply defined, of
a greyish color and of a doughy consistency
and could easily be removed from their
capsules.  the diagnosis of amyloidosis was
made on the basis of the histological
findings, the staining qualities of the material,
its intraseptal and periarteriolar
localization, and the existence of plasmocytic
infiltrates and foreign-body giant-cell
granulomas.  amyloid deposits were also found
in the spleen, kidney and some
coronary branches.  in regard to the pathogenesis,
it is suggested that the exposure
to aluminium products for more than 10 yr. might
have constituted a predisposing
factor.

which is indistinguishable from that

challenge of suitably prepared recipients
with 1st-set skin homografts obtained

ted rejections of such grafts.  other bacteria

pneumococcus types ii, iii, xiv and a rough
strain, c. xerosis, b. subtilis, e. coli,
a. aerogenes, s. typhimurium, pr. vul-
garis, n. catarrhalis, h. influenzae, and
2 human virulent strains of myc. tuber-
culosis.  none of these microorganisms was
active in the induction of homograft
sensitivity in the guinea pig.  pretreatment of
recipients with gram-negative bac-
terial suspensions was associated with a slight
increase in the mean survival time
of 1st-set skin homografts.  results of this study
suggest the presence in staphylo-
cocci, as well as in group a streptococci, of antigens
related in their biologic ef-
fects to tissue transplantation antigens.

hybrids were obtained by thermal denaturation
and annealing of a mixture of two
dna's, each one extracted from a single

the formation of the heterozygous dna
double helices was proved by special experi-
ments.  the transformation procedure
excluded dna synthesis by recipient cells
prior to the formation of enzymes for
histidine and tryptophane synthesis.  it was
found that heterozygous molecules of
dna are able to transform in these conditions
the double auxotrophic cells to prototrophic
ones.  this means that both strands of
the dna double helix can serve as templates
for the m-rna synthesis.  the possi-
bility of a secondary replication of m-rna
outside the chromosome under the action

enzyme, converting histidine to urocanic
acid, was isolated in a purified form.
a highly sensitive and convenient assay for
the induced enzyme is described and
applied to show that histidase appears in the
cell 5 min. after addition of the inducer.
histidase-synthesizing capacity appears
after 2 min. and decays exponentially after
addition of actinomycin (an inhibitor
of dna-dependent rna synthesis).  the
half-time value of histidase-synthesizing
capacity of 2.4 is high, compared with the
half-time value of messenger rna.
the histidase formation after addition of
actinomycin was not only due to protein
synthesis directed by accumulated m-rna
but also by conversion of an enzymatical-
ly inactive protein, present on the moment
of actinomycin addition and product of
the specific m-rna, to the active enzyme.
the existence of this enzyme pre-
cursor was shown by means of experiments
performed in the presence of chlor-
amphenicof.  finally, numerical values for
the steady state of histidase synthesis,
reached 9 min. after addition of the inducer,
are calculated, on the basis of ki-
netics of histidase synthetic capacity, precursor
and enzyme formation  the cell
contains sufficient precursor to form
approximately 100 molecules of histidase.
the cell produces approximately 50
molecules histidase per min.  the cell ac-
quires and loses, every minute, the
capacity to make 15 molecules of histidase
per minute.  the maximal enzyme
level is 15,000 molecules per cell.

2542. symposium on the fine structure and replication of bacteria and their
parts. ii. bacterial cytoplasm
comparison of the fine structure of the
cytoplasm of the bacterial cell with that of
the 'cell in general' reveals important
differences leading to the conclusion that, in
the bacterial cytoplasm, there is little
differentiation into separate functional en-
tities.  there is no nuclear membrane, and
fine fibrils appear to extend from the nucleo-
plasm into the cytoplasm where they may
expand in all directions.  the cytoplasm is not
necessarily intersected by membranous
profiles of special configuration, as is borne
out by e. coli b and other gram-negative
organisms.  when membranous profiles
of special configuration are present, as
in the gram-positive b. subtilis, these
do not appear differentiated into clearly
definable endoplasmic reticulum, golgi
substance, microbodies, etc., and mitochondria.
as for kinetosomes, the presence
of centrioles is perhaps not very likely.  the
experiments in which tellurite is re-
duced in the cells suggest that there are
structures at the base of the flagella with
reductive capacity.  however, upon application
of the tetranitro-blue tetrazolium
technic to b. subtilis, these are not stained.
they are presumably identical with
basal granules.  the membranous structures
in b. subtilis are called chondrioids
by the author because probably one of their
functions is that they are the sites of
the respiratory enzyme chain.  in the
gram-negative p. vulgaris, the probable site
of the respiratory chain has a structure
very different from that in the bacillus; it
is not clear whether membranes are
involved in their structure.  morphologically,
even in b. subtilis chondrioids differ
fundamentally from the mitochondria in that
they are not built up from composite
membranes, they are extensions of the plasma
membrane, and they may not be completely
closed systems.  regarding this last
point, it was observed that chondrioids may
possibly stand in open connection with
the cell's environment, since its lumen is not
separated from the cell wall by a
plasma membrane.  although as yet nothing is
known about this, it does not seem to
be precluded that these membranous organelles
may function also as intracellular
transport systems.  contrary to porter's ideas
about er, the chondrioids are not
extensions of a nuclear envelope, but of the
plasma membrane.  on the other hand,
they are in the nuclear area, in direct contact
with the nucleoplasm, and therefore,
perhaps, they need not carry in their interior
some dna, as is now becoming known
for ordinary mitochondria.  the chromatophore
vesicle is of a simple structure and
in connection with the plasma membrane.  it is
covered by a single membrane and
thus resembles the granum disc, but it is much
smaller.  in tissue cells, an im-
portant function of the er is the support of protein
synthesis by ribosomes bound
to their surfaces.  evidence is now accumulating
that the active complexes for poly-
peptide synthesis in bacteria are also membrane-bound
and are series of 70s ribo-
somes using the same messenger rna molecule.
it remains a contradictory situ-
ation that the particles obtained here through release
of cytoplasm from protoplasts
in diluted, rather crude fixing media, and identified
as ribosomes, could not be
recognized as such in thin sections of the ryter-kellenberger
fixed protoplasts.
this point is much in need of clarification.  but
even if the cytoplasm in the thin
sections of the protoplasts is in a state of
dispersion brought about artificially, it
is still apparent from the various micrographs
that basically the cytoplasm is a
network of presumably linear arrays, with many
interconnections due to fibrillar
systems.  fibrils from the nucleoplasm penetrate
deeply into the cytoplasm.  the
presence of fine fibrils of various thicknesses,
electron densities, and orientations
makes high-resolution study of the cytoplasmic
details an intriguing prospect from
which much fundamental information can be
gained.  the organizational pattern on
the ultrastructural level in bacteria reveals
fundamental similarities and divergen-
cies from that in the 'cell in general'.

906. molecular mechanism of genetic recombination in bacterial transformation
the mechanism of dna incorporation into
the recipient cell chromosome was in-
vestigated in a b. subtilis transformation
system.  the recipient cells were auxo-
trophic for 2 linked markers.  hybrid dna
used for transformation was heterozy-
gous for one of these markers.  no differences
in transformation activity were found
when the effect of native and hybrid dna was
compared.  according to the authors
this observation is easily explained if we accept
that each of both complementary
strands of the donor dna can be incorporated
into the recipient chromosome with
equal probability.  the results on the segregation
of genetic characters in the pro-
geny of transformed cells are also consistent
with the model of independent incorpo-
ration of both dna strands.  some calculations
were done on the probability of the
integration of a single dna strand carrying a
particular genetic marker, and on the
probability of recombination leading to double transformants.

1520. multiplication of bacteriophages
the reproduction of bacteriophages requires
the participation of bacterial metabol-
ism.  synthesis of the viral protein components
is accomplished by the same me-
chanism as ordinarily produces bacterial
proteins; however, for the synthesis of
nucleic acids (dna or rna) enzymes may
be required which are not present in non-
infected bacteria; their formation is then
induced by the virus itself.  the fundamental
biological processes of replication, transcription
and translation are discussed in
this context.

1361. the mechanism of histidase induction and formation in bacillus subtilis
the role of the inducer, l-histidine, in the
synthesis of histidase (l-histidine am-
monia lyase) in b. subtilis was investigated.
it was found that induced cells poisoned
with actinomycin, an inhibitor of rna synthesis,
lose their capacity for the forma-
tion of a protein precursor of histidase at a rate
which is independent of the presence
or absence of the inducer.  these results show
that the inducer does not increase
the intracellular level of histidase-specific
messenger rna by preventing the des-
truction of the major portion of this material,
the fraction that is engaged in pro-
tein synthesis.  the possibility has not been
excluded that the inducer exerts its
effect by bringing about the stabilization of
the messenger rna that is still attached
to dna or has not yet become attached to
ribosomes.  alternatively, the inducer may
actually stimulate the synthesis of
histidase-specific messenger rna.  the conver-
sion of the precursor to active enzyme
appears to involve polymerization of mono-
mers, rather than the release of
ribosome-bound inactive enzyme.

1362. the synthesis of phage and host dna in the establishment of lysogeny
a method of extraction is described which
prevents excessive fragmentation of bac-
terial dna.  the larger bacterial dna can
then be separated from the phage dna
on sucrose gradients.  the relative amounts
of phage and host dna made at various
times during infection of s. typhimurium
with phage p22 leading to lysogeny have
been determined.  phage-specific dna
synthesis begins at about 4 min, continues
to increase for 2-4 min, and then decreases
until complete repression is attained
at 16 min.  autonomous phage dna synthesis
remains repressed from then on.  bac-
teria-specific synthesis proceeds at a
decreasing rate until about 16 min, when
almost complete inhibition is reached.
when dna synthesis recovers in the in-
fected cells, only host-specific material
is made.  a new species of dna, which is
made only when phage dna is synthesized,
has been detected.  the possible implica-
tions of these findings in the understanding
of the lysogenic interaction is discussed.

438. lag period characterizing the entry of transforming deoxyribonucleic acid
into bacillus subtilis
the kinetics of appearance of transformants
as a function of time of exposure to
dna has been studied.  a short lag period
of approximately 1 min at 37 c is evi-
dent when the transformation is terminated
with deoxyribonuclease.  the length of
this lag is independent of the genetic trait
transferred.  moreover, the lag is unaf-
fected by transforming dna concentration,
by the presence of homologous unmarked
dna, and by shearing and cross-linking of
the transforming dna.  the lag shows
a strong inverse temperature dependence.
the energy of activation is 13.9 kcal.
the lag is abolished when the transformation
is terminated by washing instead of
by addition of deoxyribonuclease.  these results
are taken to indicate an immediate
adsorption of dna to cells, followed by a
deoxyribonuclease-sensitive period of
1 min, during which time the genetic trait
is entering the cell.  these results make
feasible an investigation of the configuration
assumed by the dna molecule during
entry into the cell.

439. configuration of transforming deoxyribonucleic acid during entry into
bacillus subtilis
a correlation was obtained between map
distance and the length of the lag period
preceding the appearance of pairs of genetic
traits after the addition of dna to a
competent culture of b. subtilis.  the results
are taken to indicate that dna enters
competent cells in lengthwise fashion.
the smallest length of transforming dna
which can participate in a recombination
event, and the number of nucleotide pairs
which enter the cell per unit time, have
been estimated.  the evidence indicates
that only part of the lag period is devoted
to the transport of dna into the cell.
the significance of these results with
respect to the mechanism of entry of dna
into the cell is discussed.

2564. chemical inactivation and reactivation of transforming dna (russian)
the kinetics of the inactivation of linked
and unlinked genetic markers by means
of hno2 or uv light was studied.  closely
linked markers are inactivated simul-
taneously, unlinked markers are inactivated
independently.  it seems that the
chemical attack on dna impairs a large part
of macromolecule, including many
cistrons.  it was shown by genetic experiments
that chemical inactivation prac-
tically does not influence the process of dna
inclusion into competent cells.  by
means of viscosity measurements it was
shown that the molecular weight and
macromolecular properties of dna do not
significantly change during chemical
inactivation by means of hno2.  two explanations
for the inactivation of trans-
forming activity of dna are discussed  (1) structural
deteriorations, preventing
integration of dna molecule into the genome of
recipient cell, or (2) deletion of
a chain unit out of dna chain resulting in wrong
reading of code triplets.  it was
previously described in the literature that extensive
inactivation leads to a state
of dna, apparently more resistant than the initial one.
inactivation does not con-
firm to exponential kinetics.  the authors discuss the
coding mistake hypothesis
as an explanation for this remarkable fact.  extensive
hno2 or uv light action re-
sults in multiple lesions in the dna molecule and
leads to reactivation because
the deletions restore correct reading of the code
in a large part of dna molecule.
on the basis of this explanation reactivation of
chemically injured dna by means
of fusion and annealing with homologous but
genetically inactive dna, or by slight
fragmentation of dna by means of ultrasonic
vibrations may be expected.  attempts
to achieve reactivation by both methods gave
positive results.

2565. separation of the transforming and viral deoxyribonucleic acids of a
transducing bacteriophage of bacillus subtilis
the authors used the transducing b. subtilis
phage ps 10 and present the fol-
lowing experimental data  dna isolated from
ps 10 is effective for transformation
of competent b. subtilis cells.  ps 10 dna is
distinguishable from b. subtilis dna
by its higher density in a cs2so4 gradient and
its lower thermal denaturation
temperature.  the transforming activity present
in dna from ps 10 denatures at
a temperature characteristic of b. subtilis dna
rather than of viral dna.  the
transforming activity of ps 10 dna bands in a
cs2so4 gradient with bacterial dna.
this data indicated that bacterial dna is
incorporated into phage ps 10 without
being integrated in the viral dna.  this incorporated
bacterial dna is involved
in transduction.

2529. repair of damage induced by a monofunctional alkylating agent in a
transformable, ultraviolet-sensitive strain of bacillus subtilis
a uv sensitive, transformable strain of
b. subtilis (uvr-) was unable to carry out
host cell reactivation of the virulent
bacteriophage spo1.  the ratio of the slopes
(kuvr-/kuvr+) of the uv inactivation curves
was 6-8 for cells or for whole phage, and 2
for indole+ transforming dna or for
spo1 phage dna measured in a transforming
system.  whole phage inactivated with
nitrogen mustard showed greater survival on
uvr+ cells than on uvr-; there was no such
difference for whole phage inactivated with
methyl methanesulfonate.  whole uvr+ cells
recovered from uv induced damage, as
determined by an increase in extractable
transforming activity during a period of
incubation in which net dna synthesis did
not occur.  uvr- cells were unable to reco-
ver from uv induced damage but they did
recover from methyl methanesulfonate
induced damage in similar experiments.
density labeled (h2n15) methyl methanesul-
fonate treated uvr+ cells incubated in (h1n14)
medium containing (h3) thymidine show-
ed a 3-fold increase in extractable transforming
activity, with no formation of new
dna molecules as determined by pyknometric
analysis.  the repair of damage in-
duced by uv irradiation differs by at least one
step from the repair of damage in-
duced by methyl methanesulfonate.

1451. the biosynthesis of 5-hydroxymethyldeoxyuridylic acid in
bacteriophage-infected bacillus subtilis
when phage  e, which contains
5-hydroxymethyluracil in its dna in place of thymine,
infects b. subtilis, enzyme changes
occur in the host organism which can account
for the synthesis of the abnormal base.
deoxycytidylate deaminase increases at
least 90-fold and the product of its action,
deoxyuridylic acid, is converted directly
into the deoxynucleotide of 5-hydroxymethyluracil
by a hydroxymethylase enzyme.
the activity of thymidylate synthetase, which also
uses deoxyuridylic acid as
substrate, decreases rapidly after phage infection.

5574. death anxiety in children with a fatal illness
the author reports studies of a series
of 50 children hospitalized because of fatal
illness due to leukemia or some other
form of cancer.  it was postulated that the
younger children would experience
separation anxiety while the older children
would be more likely to experience
death anxiety.  in general the hypothesis
was supported by the results of the study.
there was some evidence to indicate that
the younger children perceive death
anxiety but deal with it in more symbolic form.
in older children, it was felt that boys
tended to react to death anxiety by acting out
behavior while girls tended to become depressed.

1209. the theory and practice of the family diagnostic.  ii. theoretical
aspects and resident education
family intervention and observation have proved
useful in 3 areas.  the 1st of these is observation of the
psychosocial context in the patient.  on admission to a
mental hospital the phenomenon of extrusion and separ-
ation from the family is evident, and the need for study
of the interaction between the patient and his family
milieu is vital.  the 2nd area where the family inter-
view has a major role is resident education.  the tra-
ditional medical education of the ill prepares the stu-
dent for consideration of the multifactorial problems of
emotional disorder in which balances between mem-
bers of a group may be the issue rather than external
pathogenes.  the family interview offers a unique point
of observation of factually evident and emotionally con-
vincing group data.  in addition to the observation of
family phenomena, mutual understanding of others'
problems is created.  finally, the family interview
serves as an instrument for data collection and hypo-
thesis seeking in relating individual psychopathology
to family adaptations.  the patient and his family at
the time of admission are dealing with a crisis.  some-
times this is traumatic, such as the unexpected loss
of a young marital partner, an unexpected illness, or
a financial reverse.  more commonly, however, it is
developmental being a natural part of the life cycle.
characteristically, the developmental task involved
in dealing with the crises has been postponed so that
one does not see the family at the age specific and ap-
propriate time for this task.  the crisis emerges dis-
ruptively because of inevitable biological maturation,
personal decision, or social expectation.  a primary
concern of the leader is to determine what life task is
being faced.  families have a mentally ill member not
merely because they are dealing with the vicissitudes
of life.  they are unable to cope with the crisis, be-
cause of the feelings which are aroused.  each life cri-
sis leads to a particular constellation of effects in any
given family.  these include primarily, sadness, anger,
and guilt, but there may well be specific affective con-
stellations appropriate to different developmental tasks.
the patient's inability to cope with a life crisis is due
to his particular adaptation of a style of dealing with
feelings that is employed by other members of the family.

265. studies in personality.  ii. a bio-psychological and experimental
approach to problems of human adaptation in modern society
experimentally determined fixation-ambivalence
measures are related to some anxiety estimates obtain-
ed from a projective test in a group of male adolescents.
it is shown that (1) fixation increases with increase in
corporal injury anxiety when ambivalence is kept con-
stant, (2) ambivalence increases with increase in separa-
tion anxiety when fixation is kept constant, (3) extremely
hetero-fixated subjects show presence of intense guilt
and absence of aggression towards the mother; one ef-
fect of this system of organizers seems to be
suicidal
tendencies, (4) extremely ambivalent subjects have in-
tense separation anxiety; one effect seems to be suicidal
tendencies combined with high ambition and impaired
cognitive capacity.

2837. early indicators of outcome in schizophrenia
the case material of 50 persons who
were seen at a child guidance center in child-
hood or adolescence and were later
hospitalized with schizophrenia were examined
intensively.  the study concentrated
especially on the differences associated with
chronicity vs. hospital release.  the
following 12 factors were significantly related
to chronicity  (1) psychotic or schizoid
pathology in the mothering person, (2) no se-
paration of any kind from the pathogenic
families, (3) pre-illness history of poor so-
cial and sexual adjustment, (4) failure
to continue in treatment (during childhood)
for at least 3 mth., (5) less acting out
in the community, (6) neither disorientation
nor confusion on admission, (7) no
symptoms of depressive psychosis, (8) premor-
bid schizoid personality, (9) no clear
precipitating events, (10) no concern with dying
during the acute phase of the illness,
(11) length of onset over 6 mth., and (12) schi-
zophrenic reaction in patients' heredity.
items 1, 2, and 5 were derived from early
life history data and are thought to be
new to the literature of prognosis in schizo-
phrenia.  the remaining 8 factors can be
scored from hospital data alone, and have
been cited in previous prognostic studies.

4854. on the formation of object-relations and identifications of the
kibbutz child
some of the issues relevant to the early
stages of object relation formation and
identification of kibbutz children are
discussed.  for this purpose the child rearing
milieu of the kibbutz child is described
and some clinical illustrations are given.
the relationship to the mother is seen
as the main object-relation and those to the
educators as transient-interchangeable
need-satisfying relationships.  on the basis
of retrospective analytical material it
appears that in the course of development
the two relations as well as the two
respective, originally distinct, object represen-
tations are synthetised into one.  the
conditions of communal education, character-
ised by double object-relation formation
from birth on, are seen as factors that in-
tensify the 'normative crisis of infancy',
especially the transition from the symbio-
tic to the separation-individuation stage
of object-relation development.

2953. the death of a parent
in the case of depressive illnesses the death
of either parent prior to the child reach-
ing the age of 15 seemed to be correlated
as a significant contributory factor.  with
this exception, statistical studies suggest
that it is the death of a mother in the first
7 yr. of a child's life, as opposed to that
of a father, that is potentially an etiologi-
cal factor for the future development of
psychoses, delinquency and psychoneuroses.
the case histories of 6 boys who had lost
their fathers were given.  in each instance
there was distinct evidence that the psychological
symptoms and behavioral disturb-
ances were to be attributed in large measure
to the effect of the death upon the child,
and that in some cases the symptom choice was
to be correlated with specific cir-
cumstances surrounding the death of the father.
in some cases it was the unresolved
grief reaction in the mother which helped to
perpetuate the disorder in the child.  re-
solution of this in the mother during therapy
led to improvement in the child's func-
tioning.  in other instances improvement
occurred especially when the child ceased
to be preoccupied with a close identification
with the dead father.  those boys who
were involved most closely in their mother's
grief reactions were the ones who were
most disturbed.  the brief treatment given
these boys and their mothers appeared
to be responsible for the considerable
amelioration of symptoms that resulted.  ther-
apeutic intervention is worthwhile,
especially in those instances where there is an
unresolved grief reaction in the mother.

1848. the child's concept of death
in this translation of a paper, which first
appeared in 1912, it is shown, according
to freud, how far a child's appreciation
of being dead differs from its true signifi-
cance.  death means a reversible decrease
in life functions, that can be interrupted
at any time, like sleep.  at other times it
may mean a temporary separation; but
always it is in man's power to change it.
in this concept, the child's unconscious
finds license for his sadism.  cruelty to
animals and death wishes against persons
close to him appear, in overcompensation, as
exaggerated pity for dead creatures
and the belief in man's power over life and death.

1849. mother child interaction during separation individuation
after a stage of normal autism during the
1st weeks of extrauterine life, the infant
passes into a symbiotic phase, gradually
emerging from this stage of dual unity at
the end of the 5th mth and during the 6th mth.
just before this, the next phase
separation individuation begins.  four
characteristic subphases of this separation
individuation process are described
differentiation, the practicing period, association
and a stage, characterized by unfolding
of complex cognitive functions.  the relation
of mother and child throughout these
subphases are studied and illustrated by clinical
material.  a poor relation between mother
and child in 1 subphase does not necessarily
or usually preclude impressive changes
for the better in the next subphase.

2736. the emotional needs of children in hospital
hospitalization of a child for physical
reasons brings with it separation from pa-

as well as the probability of subjection
to frightening and painful procedures.
unless steps are taken to prevent or modify
the resultant stress, behavioral
disturbances may arise and may result in per-
manent damage to the developing personality.

2906. early childhood separations
every child in this long-term study of child
rearing showed significant reactions to
ordinary separations by about 1 yr. of age.
the similar pattern of response in this
group of children suggests a biologically
determined cause.  the clinging reaction
appeared when the child became mobile and
able to move away from his mother re-
gardless of the frequency or duration of his
separations.  the majority of the mothers
did not understand this natural phenomenon
and regarded the clinging and crying of
the 1-year-old as evidence of spoiled or
regressed behavior.  the pediatrician can
be helpful to a mother by anticipating and
explaining separation responses, by indi-
cating their universality, and by giving
specific recommendations for gradual changes
to modify these reactions.

9787. changes in developmental quotient under two conditions of maternal
separation.
developmental scales were
administered to 2 groups of infants during and sub-
sequent to a temporary period of institutionalization.
although both groups experienced maternal separa-
tion, only 1 group was subjected to deprivation, in
that it received very much less stimulation than the
other.  results from a longitudinal testing program
show that the scores of the deprived group during
the period of separation were significantly lower than
those of the nondeprived group, no progressive de-
terioration of scores took place in the course of
institutionalization, immediately following return
home, while the scores of the nondeprived group re-
mained constant, those of the deprived infants jumped
to the level of the other group.  3 theories regarding
the mechanism underlying the association between
deprivation and developmental retardation are exam-
ined and it is suggested that an explanation in moti-
vational terms best fits the results obtained.

1808. separation anxiety  a factor in the object relations of
schizophrenic patients.
the thesis is advanced that
special vulnerability to separation anxiety is a crucial
factor in the schizophrenic's difficulty in establishing
and maintaining satisfactory interpersonal relationships.
2 major reasons for this are lack of autonomy and lack
of object constancy.  without a stable autonomous
capacity for self-regulation and adaptation, he is inordi-
nately dependent upon others for help, protection, and
direction.  without object constancy, he is unable to
maintain a stable representation of the needed person in
the latter's absence.  evidence is presented from the
intensive psychotherapy of schizophrenic patients.
many of the vicissitudes of the doctor-patient relation-
ship center about the patient's separation anxiety and
his attempted defenses against it.  these include clinging,
perceptual and cognitive distortions designed to deny
separation, and recourse to substitute objects.  promi-
nent in many of these efforts is the attempt to reverse
passive victimization into active mastery.  the practical
implications of this thesis for the treatment of schiz-
ophrenic patients are discussed.

cantly higher among those who reported separation

that an apparent association between relatively high
cornell medical index score and history of separation
experience may be understandable in terms of a cause-
effect relationship between separation experience and illness.

1463. investigations of lens protein and microelectrophoresis of
hydrosoluble protein in senile cataract
the investigations on lens protein and
on agar-microelectrophoresis of hydro-
soluble protein in normal lenses and in those affected with senile cataract re-
vealed the following facts  (1) in opaque
lenses, a diminution of the total protein
and the soluble protein takes place, as
well as an increase in the amount of in-
soluble protein.  the decrease in the
quantity of soluble protein is higher than the
increase of insoluble protein which does
not only point to a transformation of the
soluble protein into the insoluble variety,
but also to the disappearance of a protein
fraction from the lens.  changes in the
quantity of soluble protein are accompanied
by the decrease of protein in slow fractions
of the electropherogram and even by
the disappearance of these fractions and
the increase of the amount of protein in
fractions of medium velocity.  with the
development of cataract and the mature
phase of cataract, all these processes
become more and more distinct.  in this
respect, a strong parallelism exists between
the protein changes and the clinical
picture of senile cataract.  (2) qualitative
and quantitative changes which occur in
the protein of normal lenses with advancing
age show a character similar to those
in senile cataract, however, they are less
pronounced.  in this instance, the de-
crease in the quantity of soluble protein is
likewise closely associated with the
diminution of the protein content in the slow
fractions of the electropherogram.
(3) the changes in the soluble protein content
of the lens and the alterations of
the protein amounts in the slow fractions which
always accompany the former,
play the principal role in the aging process
of the lens and in the development of
senile cataract.  (4) the investigations
seem to indicate that the aging processes,
of lenses as well as the development of
senile cataract are of a similar character,
but of different intensity.  (5) undoubtedly,
the processes of transition from slow
fractions of soluble protein into faster ones
and the transformation of part of the
soluble protein into insoluble protein which is
likely to be associated with these
processes as well as the partial disappearance
of total protein from the lens seem
to play a very important part in the mechanisms
pertaining to the development
of cataract.

1949. studies on the soluble proteins of bovine lens.  immuno-
chemical analyses of protein fractions
the lyophilized soluble lens proteins
were dissolved in 0.005 m phosphate buffer
at ph 6.8 and the solution was subjected to
column chromatography on deae (die-
thylamino ethyl) cellulose.  elution was
accomplished by changing the ph and ionic
strength of the eluting buffer.  the components
were fractionated by stepwise elu-
tion.  the lens proteins were separated into
17 fractions by column chromatogra-
phy.  these fractions were compared with
a, b and y crystallines for electrophore-
tic mobility, and the antigenic purity of each
fraction was examined immunochemi-
cally.  the results showed that while the
fractions were not completely pure they
were purer than the a, b and y crystalline
fractions, and that f-1-a, b, c and d
corresponded to y crystalline, while
f-2-a, b, c, d, e and f corresponded to b
crystalline and f-3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and
9 to a crystalline.

3107. studies on y-crystallin from calf lens.  ii.  purification and
some properties of the main protein components
four proteins belonging to the y-crystallin group
were purified by chromatography
on sulphoethyl-sephadex and phosphate-cellulose
columns.  the proteins were homo-
geneous in gel and immunoelectrophoresis
experiments and could be crystallized.
their molecular weights, n-terminal amino
acid sequences and antigenic structures
were all similar, but their amino acid
compositions and the sulphydryl groups con-
tained showed certain dissimilarities.  it
is probable that the 4 proteins possess
small differences in their primary structure,
which are not associated with the
antigenic sites and which may have arisen
from mutations during evolution.

3105. studies on the subunits of a-crystallin and their recombi-
nation
earlier investigations have shown that, in
the presence of high concentrations of
urea, a-crystallin from bovine lens is split
into a number of subunits with apparent-
ly different electrophoretic mobilities but
similar molecular weights.  the recom-
bination of these subunits after removal of
the urea has been studied by ultracentri-
fugation and immunoprecipitation techniques.
it was found that maximal recombina-
tion was obtained when the ionic strength
during the removal of the urea was high
(>0.2), whereas at low ionic strengths a
molecule with only half the molecular weight
of native a-crystallin and a much lower
sedimentation coefficient was obtained.  a
complete recovery of the structure of
native a-crystallin was never obtained, even
at high ionic strengths, as was evident
from electrophoretic and quantitative preci-
pitin analyses.  the subunits were
fractionated by chromatography on deae-cellu-
lose in the presence of 7 m urea.
the purification was followed by polyacrylamide-
gel electrophoresis.  after removal of
the urea at high ionic strength, 2 of the
fractions obtained showed reactions of
only partial identity with native a-crystallin
in immunodiffusion tests, but all other
fractions showed complete identity.  the
differences in the electrophoretic
mobilities of the fractions in the presence of
urea persisted after removal of the urea.
all fractions had much higher sedimen-
tation coefficients in the absence of urea
than in its presence, although the values
for urea-treated unfractionated a-crystallin
obtained after removal of the urea
were not reached even at high ionic strengths.
the amino acid composition of the
fractions was found to differ.  these
observations suggest that a-crystallin is com-
posed of a number of chemically different,
but related, subunits of approximately
the same size, which are bound together
by nonspecific, noncovalent bonds, pos-
sibly hydrophobic bonds.  moreover,
when isolated, these subunits have the ability
to associate and form molecules of
high molecular weight.

3106. fractionation of b-crystallin from calf lens by gel fil-
tration
b-crystallin was isolated from calf lenses
by a combination of gel filtration on
sephadex g-75 and vertical-column zone
electrophoresis.  it was subdivided into
4 fractions by subsequent gel filtration on
dextran gels with low cross-linkage.
each fraction showed only 1 major peak in
the ultracentrifuge, the sedimentation
coefficients of which were 13.6, 9.6, 4.9 and
4.2 s for fractions i-iv, respectively.
however, all 4 fractions contained some
additional minor components, as revealed
by sedimentation and immunoelectrophoretic
analyses.  the fractionation procedure
may be of value as a first step in the isolation
of individual proteins of the b-crystal-
lin group.

195. properties of a cold-precipitable protein fraction in the
lens
a soluble protein fraction which precipitates
in aqueous solutions at temperatures
below 10  c has been isolated from the rat
lens.  this fraction appears to be re-
sponsible for the reversible 'cold cataract'
which has been seen to develop when
young mammals are exposed to temperatures
below 10  c.  as the rat ages, the
concentration of this protein fraction
decreases, but the fraction does not com-
pletely disappear, even from the lenses
of 3-year-old rats.  although the molecular
species comprising this fraction appear to
be homogeneous in the ultracentrifuge,
disc electrophoresis and immunodiffusion
have shown that they are a heterogeneous
mixture of a-, b- and y-crystallin subunits.
the ability of the cold-precipitable
protein (ccp) fraction to precipitate in the
cold depends upon its concentration and
the ionic strength and ph of the solvent.  in
solutions of ph 4.0, some aggregation
of the 4 s cpp occurs to form a 17 s component,
which no longer precipitates in
the cold.  the ability of this protein fraction to
precipitate in the cold may depend
on hydrophobic bonding and its influence on the
conformation of the protein.

773. the effect of radiation on lenticular epithelial enzymes
in young rabbits
the mitochondrial fraction and the soluble
fraction of the epithelial cells of the lens
from 6-week-old new zealand white male
rabbits, exposed to 800 r of whole-head
x-irradiation, were evaluated for glucose
6-phosphate dehydrogenase, isocitrate
dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase,
glutathione reductase, glyceraldehydephos-
phate dehydrogenase, purine nucleoside
phosphorylase, nadph2 diaphorase, and
nadh2 cytochrome c reductase activities.
increased enzyme activities were noted
in the irradiated lenticular tissues for
purine nucleoside phosphorylase, nadph2
diaphorase and nadh2 cytochrome c
reductase.  decreased activities for glucose
6-phosphate dehydrogenase, malate
dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase and gly-
ceraldehydephosphate dehydrogenase
were observed in the lenticular tissues of ir-
radiated animals.  the activity of isocitrate
dehydrogenase was the same in the ir-
radiated and in the control animals.

465. conversion of a-crystallin of bovine lens into insoluble
protein in vitro
a-crystallin can be converted into an insoluble
form by treatment with alloxan and
to a very small extent with iodoacetate.
other reagents such as hcl, naoh, reduced
glutathione, hydrogen peroxide,
mercaptoethanol, were not able to convert a-crys-
tallin into an insoluble form.  the
alloxan treated insoluble a-crystallin could be made
soluble by treatment with 7 m urea.
the product thus made soluble had the same
electrophoretic mobility as a-crystallin,
but showed cross reaction with a-crystallin
in ouchterlony plate and did not have
proteolytic activity.  alloxan was effective in
producing cataract of rabbit lens when very
small amounts were injected into the
aqueous.

1972. structural studies of a-crystallin
a-crystallin has been isolated from the cortex
of ox lens by isoelectric precipitation
followed by chromatography on deae-cellulose.
the amino acid composition is in
agreement with that reported for a-crystallin
prepared by a different method.  there
is one thiol group/20,000g. of protein
(20,000 is the order of magnitude of the sub-
unit molecular weight), and disulphide
bonds are absent.  the thiol group has been
alkylated with radioactive iodoacetate
in the presence of urea.  partial acid hydroly-
sis of the alkylated protein gives,
according to the conditions, mainly 3 radioactive
peptides or nearly exclusively one
radioactive dipeptide.  the dipeptide is n-seryl-
(s-carboxymethyl) cysteine, ser-cmcys.
the 2 other peptides are probably the tri-
peptides related to ser-cmcys.  the
simplest interpretation of these results is that
the sequence around the cysteine residue
is a common structural feature of the sub-
units of a-crystallin.

1751. on the subunits of a-crystallin
a-crystallin was isolated from total
water-soluble lens extract by preparative zone
electrophoresis on starch or pevikon
c870 blocks and purified by density gradient
centrifugation and sephadex chromatography.
these preparations were treated with
urea or sodium dodecyl sulphate and
submitted to electrophoresis on polyacrylamide
gels containing either urea or sodium
dodecyl sulphate.  whereas in 7 m urea a large
number of zones was detected, only
three bands were observed in 1% sodium dodecyl
sulphate.  on the other hand, the
sedimentation coefficient had the same value in both
media.  the authors re-investigated the
n-terminal amino acid content in the starch block
preparations and compared the result
with that obtained from the preparations isolated
according to their new procedure.  the
concentration of dinitrophenyl-glutamic acid
was lower in the purified samples.
urea-treated samples had the same concentration
of n-terminal glutamic acid whereas
the concentration of the 'trace' end-groups did
not change.  sedimentation-diffusion
equilibrium in the analytical ultracentrifuge
revealed a slight heterogeneity in the
purified samples.  electron micrographs of
electrophoretic and of further purified
samples were very similar.  at neutral or
slightly alkaline ph they showed almost
uniform spherical aggregates in which a
substructure was observed.  at acid ph,
coiled filaments rather than small globules
could be demonstrated.

1752. separation of the soluble proteins of bovine lenses on
polyacrylamide gels
the soluble proteins of bovine lenses were
separated by gel filtration on polyacryl-
amide gels.  the presence of ethylenediaminetetra-
acetate in the buffer was found
to be essential for achieving a good separation
of the lens homogenate into four
fractions - a, b, c and d.  ultracentrifugal,
electrophoretic and immunochemical
analyses were used to compare these fractions
with the soluble crystallin fractions
of the lens.  fraction a was compared
with a-crystallin, fractions b and c with
b-crystallin and fraction d with y-crystallin.
the distribution of these four protein
fractions in the nuclear and cortical parts
of calf and cow lenses was determined.
the oxidation-sensitive protein fraction of
the calf lenses was separated from
fraction b on an se-sephadex column.

1745. the deaggregation of bovine lens a-crystallin
sedimentation equilibrium studies of lens
a-crystallin at neutral ph indicate that
this material is composed of a number
of different sized species.  a study of the
effect of alkali upon a-crystallin indicates
a progressive deaggregation of the ma-
terial with increasing ph.  sedimentation
equilibrium studies were performed at ph
12.8 as well as in guanidine hydrochloride,
7 m urea, and with succinylated material.
under all of these conditions a molecular
heterogeneity was observed.  the data
indicate that independent species coexisted
under most dissociating conditions.  the
weight average molecular weights of the
succinylated, and of the alkali-, urea-,
and guanidine hydrochloride-treated
material were found to have an integral relation-
ship of 8 4 2 1, respectively.  since a
constant ratio of m2 mw was found, it was
concluded that the same spread of
distribution of molecular species occurred for
each of the deaggregating conditions.
the results in guanidine hydrochloride could
not be evaluated in this manner because
of a small concentration dependence.  these
conclusions imply that not only the
weight average molecular weight in 7 m urea
but the actual molecular weight of
each individual species in urea was one-half of
the value to be found in alkali and
one-quarter that of the succinylated material.

1747. the problem of albuminoid
albuminoid is the main constituent of the
insoluble fraction of the lens proteins.
albuminoid from the cortex of ox lens has
been fractionated on deae-cellulose in
7 m urea; peptide maps of the fractions
are very similar to those from the corre-
sponding fractions from a-crystallin.
albuminoid can be regarded as an insoluble
a-crystallin.  an undiluted ground lens
is clear but becomes turbid on dilution.  if
albuminoid is present in the normal lens,
it does not cause turbidity even when the
cellular structure is disrupted.  it is
perhaps more likely that the albuminoid is
formed on dilution of the lens mush.
the high concentration of proteins in the lens,
especially in the nucleus, entails a high
degree of order, which will be destroyed
on dilution  this phenomenon may well be
connected with the precipitation of the
albuminoid.

787. further autoradiographic studies of the lens epithelium.
normal and x-irradiated rat eyes
cell proliferation and migration in
the lens epithelium of normal and x-irradiated
rat eyes were studied by means of
autoradiography after labelling with tritiated
thymidine.  cells of the normal lens
epithelium require 16 hr. to pass from the
beginning of the synthesizing period
to the completion of mitosis.  this interval is
partitioned as follows  s period,
approximately 10 hr.; g2, slightly less than 5 hr;
and mitosis, 72 min.  following division,
labelled daughter cells migrate from the
germinative zone to the postequatorial
rows, and by 2 weeks after tracer injection
many radioactive nuclei are found in the
lens bow.  epithelial cells irradiated while
in the dna synthesis phase undergo
degeneration beginning approximately 8 hr.
after exposure.  the onset of cell death
corresponds to the time at which these cells
would normally be preparing for mitosis
indicating that they die in abortive divisions.
a small percentage of the originally
labelled cells survived until 3 days after irradi-
ation, but by 2 weeks this number fell
almost to zero.  the loss of radioactive cells
occurred most rapidly in the equatorial zone.

2627. chicken lens development  epithelial cell production and
migration
in the earliest stages of chicken lens
development, cell division occurred over the
entire lens.  cell division first stopped
in the posterior side of the lens vesicle, as
the cells differentiated into primary lens
fibers.  after the annular pad developed,
cell division occurred, for the most part,
in the anterior surface epithelial cells.
shortly after hatching and thereafter, a
germinative zone, consisting of a narrow
band of epithelial cells adjacent to the
annular pad developed.  the cells from the
germinative zone migrated slowly and
differentiated first into annular pad cells and
then into lens cortex fibers over an
estimated 2-year period.  this slow migration
of cells in the lens is discussed in
relation to the failure of the adult chicken to de-
velop radiation cataracts.

1494. selenium content of fish flour in relation to kwashiorkor and dental
caries
the fact that fish flour was shown to be a rich source of
dietary selenium (169 p.p.m. may have important implications (i.e. deleterious
effect on teeth) in the treatment and prevention of protein malnutrition.  it
indicates that some disease syndromes in man may be a manifestation of selenium
deficiency.  it is recommended that the role played by selenium in protein
malnutrition should be given serious consideration by research workers.

socio-economic class had a mean selenium content of 0.021 p.p.m.

1577. mode of action of selenium in relation to biological activity of
tocopherols
dietary selenium at levels below 1 ppm has a partially beneficial effect
upon nutritional muscular dystrophy but is ineffective or detrimental
at higher levels.  the role of selenium in improving the effectiveness of
vitamin e is due at least in part to the fact that dietary selenium increases
the retention of the a-tocopherols, especially d-a-tocopherol.  this has been
shown by chemical determination of plasma tocopherols and also by tracing the
activities of tritiated tocopherols and selenium75 in serum and in various
fractions of serum proteins in chicks receiving these nutrients alone and in
combination.  se75 and h3-a-tocopherol activities followed each other very
closely in the serum proteins.  these studies indicated that vitamin e may be
carried by a selenolipoprotein fraction associated with serum y-globulin.  thus,
one biological role of selenium appears to lie in a selenium-containing
compound which acts as a carrier of vitamin e and which may function in
absorption, retention, prevention of destruction, and perhaps transfer across
cell membranes of d-a-tocopherol, thereby enhancing its biological activity
in the blood and perhaps in cells throughout the body.

3123. effect of sodium selenate on acute poisoning with thallium
experiments were performed on wistar rats weighing 150-200 g.  thallium was ad-
ministered s.c. in doses of 20 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg.  sodium selenate was
given per os in doses of 10 mg/kg 2 hr after poisoning and 5 mg/kg daily
for the next 2 days.  results indicate that sodium selenate protects the
animals from death.  it binds the thallium ions and increases their deposition
in organs.  comparison of the level of thallium in organs of treated rats
shows that selenate increases in liver by 290.6%, in kidneys by 326.8% and in
bones by 210.0%.  no influence of selenate on excretion of thallium in the
urine was found, but fecal excretion of thallium increased by an average of
45% of the treated animals.

2281. inhibition of active transport of sugars through rat intestine in vitro.
ii. action of mepacrine, atractyloside and selenite
it is shown that mepacrine, atractyloside and selenite, which had been regarded
as inhibitors of intestinal absorption of glucose, are inhibitors of active
transport of sugars in sacs of everted jejunum of rat (wilson and wiseman's
method).  mepacrine 5 x 10 -3 m and 10 -2 m inhibit, by 85% and 100%
respectively, the active transport of galactose.  with atractyloside 10 -5 m
and 10 -3 m, the inhibitions were 77% and 100% and, with selenite 10 -4 m and
10 -3 m, about 70%.  in general the inhibitors are effective within orders of
magnitude which are similar in vivo and in vitro.  atractyloside is rather more
effective in vitro than in vivo, and mepacrine rather less.  it is easier to
achieve total inhibitions of the active transport of sugars in vitro than of
intestinal absorption from isotonic solutions in vivo.

2284. analogs parasympathetic neuroeffectors.  ii. comparative pharmacological
studies of acetylcholine, its thio and seleno analogs, and their hydrolysis
products
acetylthiocholine and acetylselenocholine exert acetylcholine-like effects on
the guinea-pig ileum and frog rectus abdominis preparations.  with the
latter preparation, responses to acetylthiocholine and acetylselenocholine,
in contrast to that to acetylcholine, are not enhanced by the addition of an
anticholinesterase.  this is attributable to the relatively high activity of
the hydrolysis products, cholinethiol and cholineselenol; acetylthiocholine
and acetyselenocholine undergo enzymatic hydrolysis at approximately the same
rate as does acetylcholine.  the hydrolysis products of acetylthiocholine and
acetylselenocholine, which have effects on the guinea-pig ileum comparable
to those of the parent esters, are readily oxidized in air to the relatively
inactive choline disulfide and choline diselenide, respectively.  these
observations are helpful in explaining many of the apparently contradictory
statements in the literature regarding the actions of acetylthiocholine.

chronic poisoning with na selenite (in the drinking water) causes hepatic
cirrhosis, usually of atrophic type, in rats.  in rabbits there seems to be a
definite diabetogenic action, while attempts to demonstrate such action in
dogs have so far given inconclusive results.  the difference between these
2 species is perhaps due to the technique used (different spacing of injections
for practical reasons).  the action of selenite on the pancreas is discussed
and it is pointed out that se can replace s in sh groups, thus rendering the
latter ineffective.  both in effects on the liver and in those on the pancreas
se seems to resemble alloxan.

selenium toxicosis.  the most severe and consistent pathologic changes were
found in the myocardium and lungs.  myocardial alterations were focal to
diffuse degeneration, necrosis and early replacement fibrosis.  pulmonary
changes, consisting of edema and interstitial hemorrhages, were typical of the

2127. selenium toxicity in domestic animals
the article, with an extensive bibliography, is a compendium of available
information on selenium toxicity in domestic animals.  literature reveals
evidence of organically bound se being more biologically active, when given
orally to domestic animals, than inorganic se salts.  there is also variation
in toxicity of organic se analogs.  when exposed to ruminal digestion, there is
considerable reduction of se salts to the relatively biologically inactive
elemental se; which may result in fecal excretion of se, as such, to as much
as 40% of a single oral dose.  fluorine, molybdenum, chromium, vanadium,
cadmium, zinc, cobalt, nickel and uranium increase se toxicity.  arsenic and
tungsten give some protection against it.  bromobenzene, benzene, and
napthalene
mobilize tissue se and stimulate its excretion.  since se preparations designed
for topical application in treatment of skin disease have been available for
use
in both man and dogs, the literature has reported cases of poisoning from
misuse
of such preparations.  selenium, properly used, can be a valuable therapeutic
agent, though certain salts of se must be regarded as potentially toxic.
however, there is considerable latitude between therapeutic and/or nutritional
and toxic doses of these salts.

1845. further studies on specific transplantation antigens in rous sarcoma of
mice
mice allografted with different sarcomas, induced by the schmidt-ruppin variant
of rous sarcoma virus (rsv-sr), showed a resistance against subsequent
isografting of 9 different rous sarcomas.  transplantation
resistance could also be induced by
rous mouse tumor cells x-irradiated with 8000 r
or with cell-free tumor extracts,
containing no demonstrable virus.  no
transplantation resistance could be demon-
strated after allograft pretreatment with
various polyoma tumors or non-viral tu-
mors.  allograft pretreatment with rous
tumors induced no demonstrable resistance
against isografting of polyoma tumors.
inoculation of rsv-sr or rous chicken sar-
coma suspension into adult mice gave
no clear cut resistance against isograft-
ing of mouse sarcomas.  neither after
allografting of rous tumors nor after virus
or chicken sarcoma inoculation into adult
mice could virus-neutralizing activity be
demonstrated in the sera.  the results
demonstrate the presence of common, speci-
fic transplantation antigen(s) in different
rous sarcomas in mice and speak against
an identity between the transplantation
antigen(s) and viral antigen(s).

the efficacy of anaphylactic tests in detecting
'tumor' antigen in serum was investi-
gated.  a simple model of a tumor-antigen
study was carried out using rat tissue

acting as a mock cancer antigen.  it
was found that if byg (absolute dosage 100
ug.) had formed 1/6 of the antigen mix-
ture used for sensitization it was readily
detected when present in a concentration
of 10-3 in the serum used for challenge,
but not invariably detected in a concentra-
tion of 10-4.  if byg (absolute dosage 50
ug.) had formed approximately 1/50 of the
sensitizing mixture, it was infrequently
detected even when present in the challeng-
ing serum in a concentration of 10-2.  it
is concluded that anaphylactic tests used in
this context do not have a very high
sensitivity or discriminatory capacity.

phocytes was specific to the particular tumor used for
immunization suggesting that reaction against tumor-
specific antigens is involved.  the cells responsible are
believed to be medium-sized pyroninophilic lymphocytes
which may stimulate the immune system of the host to

one dog with spontaneous scirrhous

neoplasm in a foreign host alters the mole-
cular structure of the neoplasm, making it
antigenic when returned to the original
host.  antigens produced are also effective
against the original lesions.

744. studies on protein and nucleic acid metabolism in virus-in-
fected mammalian cells.  the formation of a virus-specific
antigen in krebs ii ascites-tumour cells infected with ence-
phalomyocarditis virus
krebs ii mouse ascites-tumor cells infected
with encephalomyocarditis virus were
found to contain, in addition to mature virus,
a virus-specific protein antigen.  an
assay, based on the ability of this antigen
to block the neutralization of purified virus
by its specific antiserum, was developed.
this antigen was present both in the cul-
ture fluid 17 hr. after the infection of cells
with virus and intracellularly, where its
titer increased at a time when viral capsid
protein was being synthesized.  within the
cell, it was mostly localized in the soluble
cell sap.  in contrast with virus, the anti-
gen did not agglutinate sheep erythrocytes,
and its immunological properties were
destroyed by digestion with trypsin.  ribonucleic
acid was not detected in concentrat-
ed preparations of the antigen, nor was the titer
of antigen affected by ribonuclease.
the antigen had a sedimentation coefficient (20 )
of approx. 14s, and its diffusion co-
efficient, determined by the method of allison and
humphrey (1960), was 3.2 x 10-7
sq. cm. sec.-1.  the particle weight of the antigen
was hence 420,000   40,000.  the
capsid protein from purified encephalomyocarditis
virus could be degraded by treat-
ment with ethanolamine into a protein of sedimentation
coefficient (20 ) of approx. 4s.
the 14s antigen, when similarly treated, yielded
a protein of similar size.  however,
no such smaller antigen was detected in virus-infected
cells.  it is concluded that the
non-hemagglutinating antigen represents a polymeric
form of the basic viral capsid-
protein molecule and that it is synthesized in the
cytoplasm of infected cells.  it may
be either an intermediate or a by-product in the
process of viral capsid-protein syn-
thesis.

1368. immunologic competence and induction of neoplasms by
polyoma virus
thymectomy at 3 days of age in several
inbred strains of mice and in an f1 hybrid
resulted in a strikingly increased frequency
of neoplasms following infection with
polyoma virus.  age susceptibility was extended
to at least 30 days of age in highly
resistant c57bl mice.  the usual stigmata
associated with thymectomy at birth were
not found in the 3-day thymectomized mice.
nonetheless the methods used to restore
immunologically deficient thymectomized
neonates were also effective in restoring
the capacity to resist polyoma virus tumor
induction: adult syngeneic spleen cells,
thymus tissue in millipore diffusion chambers
and syngeneic thymus grafts.  growth
curves of polyoma virus in kidney, salivary
glands and liver were quite similar in
thymectomized and intact litter mates.
hemagglutination-inhibition antibodies deter-
mined periodically up to 30 days after
infection were also similar in both groups.
these results are discussed in terms of
a concept involving virus-specific 'tumor'
antigens and the immunologic status of the animal.

1848. antigen analysis of sera from patients with malignant
tumors by immunodiffusion methods
immunoelectrophoresis and ouchterlony's
method were used for the antigen analy-
sis of sera from 320 cancer patients; 250
normal or non-tumorous cases served as
controls.  immunoelectrophoresis showed
abnormal precipitin lines which could not
be demonstrated in normal sera.  most of
the abnormal antigens were demonstrated
in the a2- and b1-globulin fractions.  the
distribution of these antigens differed in
individual cases and was not related to the
histopathological classification and site
of the tumors.  however, these antigens
increased in parallel with growth of the
tumors and disappeared or markedly
decreased after surgical removal of the tumor
tissue.  almost all sera of patients with
myeloma, leukemia, and malignant lymph-
oma formed one characteristic line in
the b2-globulin region and they could be dif-
ferentiated from the patterns in cases of carcinoma.

2354. isoantigenic properties of tumors transgressing histocompatibility
barriers of the h-2 system
sublines capable of transgressing h-2 histocompatibility
barriers have been derived
from strictly strain-specific tumors by 1) passage
through newborn hosts of a
foreign genotype; 2) passage through adult h-2
incompatible recipients pretreated
with isoantisera directed against the tumor cells.
the nonspecific character induced
by these procedures was usually expressed in a
number of different h-2 incompa-
tible recipients.  the changes responsible for
the conversion to nonspecific growth
appeared to proceed in a stepwise fashion.
expression of the nonspecific character
required exposure to the foreign host environment
for more than 30 days.  at this
stage and during the subsequent 3 transfer
generations, reversion to strain-specific
growth occurred on back-transfer to the
strain of origin; after 4 passages in the
foreign hosts the nonspecific character was
permanently established, however, and
could not be reverted by prolonged passage
in the original host genotype.  the
growth rate of strain-specific tumors and
their nonspecific sublines was compared
in the strain of origin.  no difference was
found with one tumor, while the strain-
specific line grew better than the nonspecific
sublines with another.  this difference
was detected in the homozygous strain of
origin and in different semi-isologous f1
hybrids.  all lines grew better in the
homozygous strain than in the f1 hybrids,
however.  a comparison was made
between the concentration of h-2 isoantigenic
surface determinants in strain-specific
tumors and their nonspecific sublines by a
quantitative absorption technique in
vitro.  all nonspecific sublines had a lower
concentration of h-2 isoantigens than
the strain-specific tumors.  this suggests
that nonspecific tumors develop as a result
of immunoselection of variants resistant
to the homograft reaction and are characterized
by a lowered concentration of
h-2 antigens.

2371. participation of 7s and 19s antibodies in enhancement and
resistance to methylcholanthrene-induced tumours
serum factors responsible for enhancement
and resistance to methylcholanthrene-
induced tumors in a syngeneic system in mice
were studied.  they were found to be
part of the serum immunoglobulin system.
the active components of specific anti-
tumor serum were always contained in the
7s (y-2) and 19s (y-1m) fraction, while
no activity was detected in the 4s fraction.
in sera which in the given dose enhanced
growth of the tumor graft, enhancing activity
was present in both the 7s and 19s
fraction of the serum and was higher in the
former.  in sera which in the given dose
influenced the interaction of the organism with
the tumor by producing resistance
to the tumor graft, both fractions were again
active, the activity of fraction 19s
being higher than that of fraction 7s.

graft containing sex-antigen
the tumor bp 1 induced by benzpyrene in c57bl
male mice contains sex-antigen.

against immunity directed against
this antigen.  the tumor, however, becomes
more resistant to immunity and the
content of sex-antigen is decreased.

2373. factors influencing the induction of enhancement and re-
sistance to methylcholanthrene-induced tumours in a syn-
geneic system
active immunological enhancement of the
growth of methylcholanthrene-induced tu-
mors was demonstrated in a syngeneic
system in mice.  enhancement was detected
3-5 wk. after preimmunization with
irradiated tumor suspension and was succeeded
after the 6th wk. by the development of
resistance to the tumor.  analysis by means
of adoptive and passive transfer showed
these to be true immunological phenomena.
enhancement and resistance were transferred
by serum and by the lymph node cells
of preimmunized mice.  threshold doses of
tumor cells were found to be the most
satisfactory for the detection of resistance
and enhancement in this system.

5512. antigenic properties of human tumours
preliminary studies on the antigenic
properties of human tumours have been
carried out using heterologous antisera,
prepared in rabbits, against a number of
different cancerous and normal tissues.
after repeated absorptions, antisera
were obtained which reacted only with
tissue antigens.  some antisera, after ab-
sorption with normal tissues, reacted only
with tumours.  seventy-two tumour and
31 normal tissue extracts were studied
by means of the ouchterlony agar gel
double diffusion technique.  the results
showed the presence of an antigen or
antigens in some human malignant tumours
which were not detectable in normal
tissues, in foetal tissues, or in hela cells.
in addition, there was some loss of
normal tissue antigens from tumours.
attempts are being made to isolate and
characterize these tumour and normal
tissue antigens.

measured by intranuclear synthesis of sv40 tumor antigen
the l.l. strain of adenovirus 7, free of

sv40 tumour antigen, demonstrable by
fluorescent antibody staining, in green mon-
key kidney, rabbit kidney, hamster embryo
and human embryo kidney cell cultures.
in green monkey and human cell cultures
there was a cytopathic effect and more
cells contained the sv40 tumour antigen
than in the other types of culture.
adenovirus 7 viral antiserum neutralized
the sv40 tumour antigen inducing
ability of the l.l. strain virus but anti-sv40
monkey serum and serum from sv40
tumour bearing hamsters did not.  an
adenovirus 7 preparation propagated
exclusively in human tissue did not induce
the sv40 tumour antigen.  the sv40
tumour antigen was entirely localised within
the cell nuclei and appeared to be
transmitted to daughter cells during mitosis.

264. fluorescent antibodies to human cancer-specific dna and
nuclear proteins
specific antigens have been demonstrated
in certain cancers.  in this study they were
obtained from an adenocarcinoma of the
colon and an ewing's sarcoma.  homogenates
were prepared and male rabbits were
immunized.  the animals were bled to death
10 days after the last injection.  testing
included fluorescent antibody methods and
agar-gel horizontal double-diffusion precipitin
test.  the pattern of reaction of these
antibodies against various cancers seems to
be dependent upon the source of the
cancerous dna-bound proteins and the salt
concentration used in their isolation.
human cancer-specific cross nuclear antigens
seem to be cross reacting rather
than identical in structure.  the cancer-specific
antibodies could be removed only
with absorption of the immune globulins with
cancerous tissues.  salt-soluble human
dna-bound proteins from an adenocarcinoma
of the colon and an ewing's sarcoma
induced the formation of cancer specific
antibodies which showed positive fta re-
actions (to a maximum titer of 1/128) against
95% of the cancerous tissues studied.
these cancer-specific antibodies gave
similar fta reactions with cell nuclei of
normal appearing liver parenchyma
adjacent to metastatic carcinoma of colon, nor-
mal appearing colon near to metastatic
carcinoma of the colon, normal appearing
colon near to carcinoma of the colon,
and a long-standing case of chronic ulcerative
colitis.  evidence is shown that this finding
possibly may represent a serological
detection of an early or latent cancerous
change in morphologically normal cells.
these cancer-specific antigens have been
identified as rounded, intranuclear dna-
bodies and nuclear proteins which can be
specifically destroyed by dnase trypsin.

266. immunology of the cancer cell: tumour-specific antigens
after a broad historical survey of immunological
studies of cancer, a review is given
of the evidence showing that antigens present in
normal cells are missing from the
malignant cells that arise from the same tissue.
this evidence is considered in con-
junction with the deletion hypothesis of carcinogenesis,
and the author emphasizes,
that in his view, the key event in carcinogenesis
is enzymatic deletion.  antigenic
gain and intensification in the course of spontaneous,
chemical, and viral carcino-
genesis is reviewed, together with experiments
demonstrating the existence of
tumour-specific antigens.  the question is then
posed: if tumours have specific anti-
gens, why is evidence for their rejection so scanty?
the occasional spontaneous re-
gression points to host resistance but its rarity
suggests that tolerance generally
develops.  consideration is given to the
application of immunological methods to
therapy and although current achievement
in this field is limited, new immunological
stratagems might yet transform the picture.
finally a plea is made for the integra-
tion of the disciplines of immunology and
cellular differentiation.  the prospect is
raised that through a synthetic and holistic
approach we might discover the suscepti-
bility of the cancer cell to re-differentiation
and re-recognition.

vergleichende renale phosphatelearance-untersuchungen
beim hyperparathyreoidismus und beim sog.  phosphatdiabetes
the analysis of the function of the kidneys give a contribution to
the pathophysiology of two different diseases of general osteopathies
whose pathogenesis or etiology are still not clear in some points.  the
phosphate clearance pre- and postoperative in one patient with hyper-
parathyroidism showed that after the removal of the adenoma of the
parathyroid the renal reabsorption of phosphate improved only tempo-
rary as a secondary form of hyperparathyroidism was already present.
in a patient with a "phosphatdiabetes" the clearance examination showed
that under a high dosage of vitamin d the reabsorption of phosphate did
not increase.  based on these results we have not continued therapy
with vitamin d which is certainly not indifferent.  comparative renal
clearance examinations were carried out in 10 patients which did not
show any disturbances of calcium/phosphate-metabolism.

absorption and excretion of toxogonin, an alkyl-phosphate antidote,
after intramuscular injection in man
tolerance, absorption and urinary excretion stu-
dies of toxogonin (bis-(4-hydroxyiminomethyl-

dote in poisoning by esterase-blocking organic
phosphates, were made on 11 men by intramuscular
injection of 250 mg. (ca. 3 mg./kg.) of the drug,
given by self-injection ampoules.  injections made
with the automatic ampoule autule caused no local
irritation.  certain facial symptoms reported can for
the time being be regarded as resorptive side-effects
of toxogonin.  maximum blood levels of 6 ug./ml.
were recorded within 20 minutes.  even after four
hours the level was still 1-2 ug./ml., a concentra-
tion amply sufficient to ensure reactivation of blood
esterases.  of the injected dose, 52% was excreted
in the urine after two hours, 87% after eight hours.
toxogonin appears to pass through the body un-
changed.

the study of osteoporosis
and osteomalacia
radiological evidence strongly suggests that
osteoporosis (with the possible exception of acute
immobilization osteoporosis) may be an irrever-
sible condition.  the changes therefore to be
expected in calcium balance when an osteoporotic
is treated are small compared with those often
seen in osteomalacia.  methods of obtaining more
accurate calcium balances are needed to show
these small changes, especially when a high
calcium intake is used.  the method of continuous
marking of stools with chromium sesquioxide
seems to provide just such a method.  using this
method, it has so far proved impossible to obtain
prolonged large positive calcium balances in
osteoporosis on either high calcium intake,
anabolic hormones, or sodium fluoride.
two alternative therapies to vitamin d have
been explored for use in vitamin d-resistant
osteomalacia.  atp has been found to be inneffective.
intravenous phosphate alone has been ineffective
in producing positive calcium balances, but is
effective as a complement to vitamin d under
certain conditions.

the aetiology and treatment of
urinary calculus
investigations in this laboratory have been
based on the hypothesis that calculus formation is
primarily a process of crystallization from super-
saturated solutions rather than one of adsorption
on a specific protein matrix, as has been postulated
by boyce and his colleagues (boyce and king,
1963).  that crystallization is the primary factor
is strongly suggested by the recent studies of
vermeulen, lyon and gill (1964).  these authors
produced artificial concretions which closely
resembled urinary calculi by immersing a rotating
wire loop in normal urine for several days and
slowly adding the appropriate stone-forming
elements.
if the above hypothesis is correct then the
factors of primary interest in urinary stone
formation are those responsible for supersaturation,
nucleation and crystal poisoning.  much remains
to be learnt about these various factors, their
inter-relationships, and their relative importance.
the significance of the urinary colloids (proteins,
muco-proteins and polysaccharides) in calculus
formation is still not clear but it is probable that
they play an important secondary role in binding
crystalline precipitates to form a non-friable
calculus.  since time is an important factor in
crystal growth such non-specific binding by
proteins would increase the chances of stone
growth and retention within the upper urinary
tract.

was made by exclusion.  the effects of dietary restriction of
calcium, sodium bicarbonate, cortisone, sodium phosphate,
sodium phytate, and cellulose phosphate were demonstrated by
calcium and phosphorus balance techniques.  all were shown
to have some urinary-calcium-lowering effect.  finally, a
chlorothiazide derivative--namely, bendrofluazide--was also
demonstrated to have a hypocalciuric effect, and the mode of
action is discussed.

effects of parathyroid hormone and other proteins in vitro
on mitochondrial metabolism
it is apparent that in addition to parathyroid hormone, several
non-hormonal basic proteins stimulate mitochondrial respiration, ion
transport, and atpase, but inhibit the 32pi-atp exchange reaction.
thus these effects may not be so uniquely a measure of the biological
actions of parathyroid hormone as the previous reports suggested.
rasmussen et al. (1964) have also isolated from parathyroid
extracts a protein that is inert in vivo but stimulates mitochondrial
transport of phosphate in vitro.  they postulated that this protein
might be yet another biologically important factor produced by para-
thyroid glands.  the latter speculation may not be warranted in view
of the uncertain specificity of protein effects on mitochondria.  all
of our tests completed to date show that the non-hormonal parathyroid
proteins c1 and c2 are unrelated either biologically, immunologically,
or chemically (by amino-acid analysis) to the parathyroid hormone.
further rigorous studies are necessary to precisely determine
whether any effects of parathyroid hormone on mitochondria validly
reflect the mechanism of action of the hormone and whether it is sound
to use the in vitro tests as bioassay tools.

the treatment of phosphatic encrusted cystitis

phosphatic encrusted cystitis is caused by
persistent infection by b. proteus or ps. pyocyaneus
associated with an alkaline urine.  its incidence
may be increasing and may follow megavoltage
therapy of a bladder tumour.  its incidence in
post-radiation cases is 2 per cent.
mandelamine often fails to relieve this
condition.  in this series of ten patients who had
failed to respond to mandelamine, eight
responded to treatment with nalidixic acid.  no side
effect of treatment was noted in the series.
nalidixic acid is of value in the treatment of b. proteus
infections of the urinary tract, and is the drug
of choice in the treatment of phosphatic encrusted
cystitis.

role of the liver in the glycoprotein mobilizing property of
parathyroid extract
studies were carried out to de-

tion of glycoprotein.  our data showed that
in hepatectomized rats, pte no longer caused
an elevation in serum glycoproteins.  how-
ever, hepatectomy did not alter the forma-
tion of glycoprotein tubular casts produced
by pte administration.  the data suggest
that the liver is the major source of the ele-
vated serum glycoproteins found in rats re-
ceiving pte.  in addition, it is possible that
pte may have a direct stimulating action
on biosynthesis of glycoprotein by the kidney.

distribution and excretion of radioactivity after parenteral

intramuscular injection the bulk of the radio-
activity was accumulated at the site of injec-
tion.  the disappearance of radioactivity from
this depot was very slow.  as late as 90 days
after the injection into rats, 20% of the
administered radioactivity was still accumu-
lated at the site of injection.  the liver was
very effective in removing labeled material
from circulating blood.  twenty-four hours
after intravenous injection in rats, about
50% of the radioactivity was recovered from
this organ.  the distribution of radioactivity
in the cow indicated that the polymer was
preferably accumulated in organs containing

parathyroid hormone (p.t.h.) on the renal tubule.  under the experimental
conditions used, no significant inward transtubular movement of p32 could be
demonstrated, ruling out tubular secretion of phosphate.  stop-flow
experiments performed in parathyroidectomized dogs before and after p.t.h.

hormone.  in addition, the stop-flow pattern indicated that this

anodized aluminium grains labelled with radiophosphorus
for medical purposes
g. b. fasolo, r. malvano, u. rosa and e. zimmer
interstitial b-therapy, by implantation in tissues of
radioactive sources, is widely applied to the treatment
of certain forms of human malignancies.  among the
radio-elements proposed for this therapeutic technique,
yttrium-90 and gold-198 are the most generally used.
radiophosphorus (32p) shows some attractive features
because of its suitable half-life (14.3 days) and its rather
high-energy b-emission (maximum energy 1.71 mev);
but the use of this radionuclide is limited by the diffi-
culties found in the preparation of safe solid sources.  the
only techniques we have found in the literature are those
reported by riechert and mundinger and by rames and
moravek, who used respectively small plastic capsules
filled with phosphomolybdic acid solution, and ca(po4),
grains, labelled with phosphorus-32.  these methods
require a delicate preparative work, and, moreover, a
large b-self-absorption effect can be expected in both
cases.
a new simple method for the preparation of grains
labelled with phosphorus-32 basically consists in ad-
sorbing labelled po4 3- ions on an active aluminium oxide
film produced by anodic oxidation of aluminium wire.
the adsorption capacity of the oxide film for po3 3- ions
is quite high, but the process is reversible: the phos-
phorus-32 activity is partially desorbed, even after
'sealing' in boiling water, when the labelled wire is kept
in isotonic sodium chloride solution.

effect of parathyroidectomy and ferric dextrin
upon calciphylactic sensitization by uremia
experiments on the rat indicate that calciphy-
lactic sensitization can be achieved by bilateral
nephrectomy.  intravenous administration of a
ferric dextrin preparation (fe-din) induces
selective calcification in the buccal mucosa,
esophagus, trachea and mediastinum of the
nephrectomized rat although it produces no such
changes in intact control animals.  conversely,
fe-din prevents the cardiovascular calcification
normally elicited by nephrectomy.  parathy-
roidectomy protects the nephrectomized rat
against the fe-din-induced calciphylaxis.
hence, it may be concluded that: 1) autologous
parathyroid hormone, in amounts secreted by
the glands, can act as a calciphylactic sensitizer
and 2) fe-din is highly effective in protecting the
cardiovascular system against uremic damage.

treatment would be.  it was found that an immediate and significant fall
in urinary phosphorus excretion best documented the diagnosis of primary
hyperparathyroidism.  over intervals up to 10 years, follow-up of the
patients suggested a favourable response of the disease to operative
treatment.

the dilution test as a measure of renal function in niobium-poisoned rats
control, female, albino rats given a water load of 50 ml/kg, excreted

the administration of a single intraperitoneal dose ranging from 10

when niobium was complexed with ascorbic acid prior to injection the
teu50 value was within control limits.  however, rats given a single
intraperitoneal dose of niobium and then given 3 doses of ascorbic acid at

influence of parathyroid activity on ion
exchange in various tissues
1. balance data from three patients with hypoparathyroidism, who were
given parathyroid extract, are presented.  the metabolic response was
complex.  the data demonstrate losses of phosphate, magnesium, sodium
and potassium which were not accounted for by destruction of either bone
or non-osseous tissues.  preferential depletion of these minerals from bone,
or loss from non-osseous tissues, must be presumed.
2. the exchange of ca45, mg28, and p32 in a spectrum of rat tissues has
been studied in sham operated, parathyroidectomized, and parathyroid
extract treated rats.  the effects of parathyroidectomy on the development
of magnesium deficiency were determined.
3. four hours after parathyroidectomy, increased transport of calcium
into bone, kidney, intestine, liver, brain, and muscle was found.  six days
after parathyroidectomy equilibrium had been reestablished and exchange
rates were identical to those in sham operated animals.
4. the administration of parathyroid extract was associated with de-
creased transport of ca15, mg28, and p32 into bone.  ca15 exchange in kidney
was reduced but in all other tissues exchange of ca15 and mg28 was in-
creased.  p32 exchange in both intestine and kidney was mardedly increased
in animals receiving the extract.
5. parathyroidectomy greatly minimized the manifestations of mag-
nesium deficiency in young rats on magnesium deficient diets.
6. the results suggest that parathyroid hormone may affect the trans-
port and exchange of calcium, magnesium, and phosphate (and perhaps
sodium and potassium) in tissues other than those usually considered to
be target organs.

excretion of inorganic phosphate in man
acute respiratory and metabolic alkalosis have
been shown to depress plasma phosphorus con-
centration in normal man.  the fall in plasma
phosphorus concentration is greater in respiratory
than in comparable levels of extracellular meta-
bolic alkalosis.  this fall is not attributable to in-
creased renal excretion or to migration into red
blood cells.  the evaluation of low serum phos-
phorus concentrations should always be carried
out with a knowledge of the ph and total co2
content of the plasma.

the relationship between vitamin d and parathyroid
hormone
marit von stedingk
the effect of parathyroidectomy and parathy-
roid hormone administration upon the concentra-
tions of plasma calcium and phosphate have been
measured in vitamin d-deficient rats and the re-
sults compared to those observed in d-fed ani-
mals.  also, the influence of dietary calcium and
phosphate content upon these responses has been
investigated.  parathyroidectomy in the d-fed ani-
mal results in a rapid fall in plasma calcium and a
biphasic plasma phosphate response with an initial
fall followed by a striking rise.  in contrast,
parathyroidectomy in the d-deficient rat is fol-
lowed by no significant change in plasma calcium
and an immediate rise in plasma phosphate that
can be prevented by the administration of para-
thyroid hormone.  dietary phosphate restriction
abolished the effect of parathyroidectomy in both
groups of animals.
administration of a dose of 500 u of hormone
to the intact d-deficient rat had little influence
upon plasma calcium; a dose of 2,000 u did in-
crease plasma calcium.  a dose of 25 u was suffi-
cient to increase the plasma calcium of the d-fed
animal.  these results are discussed in relation
to the effects of vitamin d and parathyroid hor-
mone upon mitochondrial metabolism.

decrease in serum and urinary phosphorus in man
in the course of pyrotherapy
during the fever
peak occurring a few hours after the in-
jection, urinary phosphorus (up) dis-
appears entirely.  this fact cannot be
accounted for by the parallel decrease in
gfr, because serum phosphorus level
(sp) does not increase (as it would be
expected to, should retention occur) but
on the contrary, it, too, declines to a
marked degree.
the possibility that changes in sp and
up could have been brought about by an
increased utilization of glucose was also
considered.  an intravenous glucose toler-
ance test (method of macho and licko
(8)) was carried out in another group of
patients on control days and on days of
pyrotherapy five hours after the pyrogen
administration.  an increase in the rate of
"glucose utilization" was observed
(table 2).  however a different opinion is
found in the literature.  in the course of
glucose tolerance tests, conn (3) and
comparini (9) observed a lowered rate of
glucose utilization in febrile subjects.
malizia (10) found an accentuated rate
of decline of serum phosphorus during
glucose tolerance tests in subjects with
high temperatures, but the glycemic
responses did not differ from those ob-
tained when controls without fever were
subjected to the same tests.  whether it
be for utilization purposes or not, the
fact remains that a massive transfer of
phosphorus from the serum into the
tissues takes place in fever.

relationship of maximal tubular phosphate
reabsorption to filtration rate in the dog
a maximal renal tubular rate of reabsorption of phos-
phate (tmp) has been demonstrated in the normal dog.  in
the dog, as in the man, considerable variability in the tmp
often occurs.  while some of this variability remains unex-
plained, a direct relationship between glomerular filtration
rate (gfr) and tmp can be demonstrated when the gfr is
varied over a wide range.  this relationship suggests that
glomerular intermittency may exist in the dog.

human growth hormone
clinical measurement, response to hypoglycemia and suppression by
corticosteroids
a standard test of growth-hormone secretory ca-
pacity, based on radioimmunoassay of plasma growth
hormone after insulin hypoglycemia, is described.  in
normal subjects a standard insulin tolerance test, caus-
ing an average blood glucose drop to 34 per cent of
resting values, produced a mean rise in growth hor-
mone to 45.2 millimicrogm. per milliliter at one hour,
with a total range of 25 to 70 millimicrogm. per mil-
liliter.  no response was observed in 5 hypopituitary
subjects.
under comparable hypoglycemic stimulation glu-
cocorticoid-treated patients showed a marked in-
hibition of the growth-hormone response, which was
related to dose.  subjects receiving more than 60 mg.
of cortisol equivalent per day showed a mean plasma
rise to 6.7 millimicrogm. per milliliter (range, 1.5
to 13 millimicrogm.).  subjects receiving 20 to 60 mg.
of cortisol equivalent per day showed a mean rise to
16.6 millimicrogm. per milliliter (range, 13 to 20
millimicrogm.).
inhibition of human growth hormone was also
affected by duration of glucocorticoid treatment, be-
ing greater with long-term than with short-term ad-
ministration.

hypophysectomy, replacement therapy, and the tolerance of the
euryhaline killifish, fundulus heteroclitus, to hypotonic media
hypophysectomized fundulus heteroclitus, as previously reported, survive only a
few days after transfer from salt to fresh water.  survival time is the same
when fish are tested 2 weeks or 2 months after hypophysectomy.  gradual
dilution of the external medium produces failure at an average salinity of
0.26% (0.67-0.02%).  this salinity is comparable to that causing failure after
abrupt transfer.  although failure is associated with hypochloremia, daily
injections of a balanced salt solution or 0.6% nacl shorten survival.
daily injections of teleostean neurohypophysial peptides, arginine vasotocin
(2.25 and 0.0225 pressor mu per gram) and isotocin (1.32 and 0.026 oxytocic mu
per gram) do not prolong survival.  an extract of caudal neurosecretory tissue
(urophysis) from male tilapia mossambica had no beneficial action at doses of
50 ug per gram every other day.  purified ovine prolactin.  105 mu per gram on
alternate days, maintained survival of 10 of 11 fish for the duration of the
28-day test period in fresh water, irrespective of the period of pretreatment
in salt water.  purified bovine prolactin prolonged survival and 2 of 6 fish
were maintained for 28 days.  purified bovine growth hormone was ineffective.
monkey growth hormone containing 2 u per milligram of prolactin activity,
administered at a dose of 20 ug per gram (equivalent to 40 mu per gram
prolactin activity), prolonged survival.  human growth hormone containing 4 u
per milligram of prolactin activity, at a dose of 20 ug per gram (equivalent to
80 ml per gram prolactin activity) also prolonged survival and 4 of 6 fish
were maintained for 28 days.
the ability of pituitary preparations to protect hypophysectomized
f. heteroclitus from failure in fresh water appears to be related to their
prolactin activity and not to their content of neurohypophysial peptides.
this suggests that an adenohypophysial hormone resembling mammalian prolactin
is essential for survival of this fish in hypotonic external media.  carp
pituitary preparations do not protect hypophysectomized f. heteroclitus
although f. heteroclitus pituitaries are known to be effective.

resistance to human growth hormone in pituitary dwarfism:
clinical and immunologic studies
thirteen pituitary dwarfs have
been treated with human growth hormone
(hgh), and growth acceleration with doses of
5-7 mg/week has been observed in all but one
patient.  on therapy, this 7 1/2-year-old girl grew
at a rate of 1.05 cm/month for 7 months.
thereafter, despite larger doses of growth
hormone (15 mg/week), growth rate fell to
0.27 cm/month.  this rate of growth persisted
after stopping hgh.  on retreatment on 2
occasions, acceleration of growth did not
occur.  antibodies to hgh, absent in her
serum before treatment, were repeatedly
demonstrated in her serum in high concentra-
tion (hgh binding capacity up to 100 mg/1)
during treatment.  comparable titers of anti-
body have not been found in any of the 12
other patients receiving long-term hgh treat-
ment.  the specificity of the human anti-hgh
serum differed from rabbit anti-hgh serum.
whereas both monkey growth hormone
(mgh) and hgh were effective inhibitors of
the binding of hgh-131i by rabbit antiserum,
only hgh was an effective inhibitor with
human antiserum.  in like manner, a crude
placental extract which was an effective in-
hibitor for rabbit antiserum was ineffective
with human anti-hgh serum.

influence of alloxan diabetes on
growth hormone content of the rat hypophysis
homog-
enates of adenophypophysial tissue obtained from alloxan-
injected adult male rats varying in duration and severity of
diabetes, as well as from diabetic rats maintained on an
insulin replacement regimen, were assayed in immature
hypophysectomized female rats.  the ability of these crude
hypophysial extracts to encourage tibial cartilage width ex-
pansion gain in body weight, and to depress hematocrit and
blood area levels was determined.  significant decrements in
ability to increase epiphysial cartilage width and ability to
depress hematocrits were noted 14 to 28 days following injection
of alloxan.  increasing the intensity of the diabetic state was
associated with decreased growth-promoting potency of hypo-
physial preparations as well as with decreased ability to
influence the hematological indices.  hypophysial extracts taken
from insulin-treated diabetic rats contained more growth
hormone than equivalent amounts of tissue obtained from
control rats.  it is concluded that the adenohypophyses of
diabetic rats contain diminished amounts of growth hormone
and the insulin repairs or encourages greater than normal ac-
cumulation of somatotrophin in these animals.

speculation regarding the etiological importance of
hypersecretion of growth hormone in pheochromo-

hypoglycemia, growth retardation, and probable
isolated growth hormone deficiency in a
1-year-old child
a heretofore unreported association of defects, namely hypoglycemia, growth
retardation, and deficiency of serum growth hormonelike activity in a
1-year-old child is described.  human growth hormone (hgh), 3 mg. a day for 7
days, doubled the fasting blood sugar, prevented the postprandial hypoglycemia,
and reversed the sensitivity to tolbutamide and leucine.  treatment with 1 mg.
of hgh 3 times a week produced a growth of 7 inches in 3 months compared to a
growth of 1 inch in the previous 13 months.  since the protein-bound-iodine and
the response to methopyrapone were normal and the blood level of growth hormone
was low, this case is presented as a probable isolated growth hormone
deficiency.

production, secretion, and availability

a more precise understanding of the metabolic phase of diabetes mellitus
requires reliable information concerning the synthesis, manner of release and
transport of insulin, as well as of the behavior of agents which interfere with
the actions of the hormone by inhibition or destruction.  we shall deal with a
variety of these problems here and it might be helpful at the outset to outline
first our present understanding of the chemical structure of insulin since
many useful hints flow out of a consideration of the nature of the molecule.

growth and growth retardation
various attempts have been made over the years to define growth.  from
the standpoint of this review, growth is the physiological accretion of new
tissue which is reflected in the acquisition of protein and water.  this
process in almost all instances leads to increase in size (length, weight, and
volume) and actively progresses from the fertilization of the ovum to the
period of sexual maturity where millions of cells are present in a state of
advanced organization.  with further time, growth is less and, indeed, may
become negative insofar as cells are lost.

long-term treatment of hypopituitary and of

we have treated an 8 year old hypopi-

times a week the monthly growth rate
was 1/4 inch.  as treatment continued he
became resistant.  increasing the dosage
to 3 mg. 3 times a week at the age of 12
induced a monthly growth rate of 2/5
inch.  this growth-promoting effect is at
least as great as that reported for the
li and raben preparations.  we have
also treated a 15 year old severely de-
formed 'achondroplastic' dwarf for a
year.  with 3 mg. 3 times a week he
grew 1/2 inch in the first month.  the
spurt in growth subsided.  with 5 mg.
3 times a week he grew another 1/2 inch
in a month, but growth was not main-
tained.

acromegaly
the effects of various steroid hormones on the
insulin-induced growth hormone response
and peter h. forsham
the availability of a sensitive assay for human growth hormone has made
it possible to directly measure the effects of various agents purported to
alter growth patterns.  acromegalic patients present a special problem both in
early diagnosis and in therapy.  being able to measure growth hormone in
these patients provides an accurate index of activity and a precise measure
of therapeutic effectiveness.
in an attempt to determine whether a pituitary block of growth hormone
secretion is feasible in this condition, a study was made of the effects of
estrogen, androgen and glucocorticoid administration on growth hormone
response to a standard insulin tolerance test in a patient with active acro-
megaly.  in the dosage schedules used in this study, it was not possible to
suppress either basal growth hormone secretion or blunt its responsiveness
to the normal physiologic stimulus of hypoglycemia.

practical human growth hormone
preparation and clinical use
human growth hormone was prepared from
acetone-dried pituitary powder by hot glacial
acetic acid extraction and subsequent precipita-
tion by sodium chloride and cold acetone.  the
yield was 13 per cent and the preparation was
called practical growth hormone in recognition
of its complement of corticotropin.
treatment of two dwarfs with practical growth
hormone in aqueous solution, 1 or 2 mg intra-
muscularly on alternate days, accelerated the
growth rate and there were no physical signs or
laboratory indications of adrenal stimulation or
other adverse effects.  the preparation is recom-
mended for its safety, simplicity and relatively
good yield.

hypophysectomy and the lipolytic action of epinephrine in vitro
the response of normal adipose
tissue to epinephrine (0.05 ug/ml incubation
medium) is completely abolished by hypo-
physectomy of the donor rats.  treatment of
hypophysectomized rats with crude, whole
rat pituitary extract restored the lipolytic ac-
tion of epinephrine to normal.  posterior pi-
tuitary extract and corticotropin replacement
was without effect.  thyrotropin injections
produced a partial, and growth hormone
treatment a full restoration of the lipolytic
action of epinephrine.  treatment of hypo-
physectomized rats with cortisol or cortico-
sterone reestablished the sensitivity of their
adipose tissue to epinephrine, but only when
relatively large doses of these hormones were
given.  physiological doses of triiodothyronine
(1 ug/rat/day), however, restored the nor-
mal response to epinephrine.  it is concluded
that several endocrine factors can influence
the lipolytic action of epinephrine but that
their physiological importance cannot yet be
quantitated.

c-acetyl bovine growth hormone
a procedure is described for labeling bovine growth hormone
and human albumin with c-acetylation.  the labeled molecule
was biologically and antigenically similar to unlabeled bovine
growth hormone.  following administration of the labeled
hormone to animals, the label appeared to remain attached to
the growth hormone molecule for at least 4 hours.  administra-
tion of the labeled hormone promoted growth in hypophysec-
tomized rats and increased the free fatty acid concentration
in rabbit serum to a degree comparable with that seen following
administration of unlabeled growth hormone.  rabbit anti-
bovine growth hormone serum neutralized the rat growth
response to the acetylated hormone, and immunized rabbits
had altered isotope dilution and no increase in serum free fatty
acids after intravenous injection of the labeled hormone.
.I 581

growth hormone
growth hormone influences protein, fat,
carbohydrate, and mineral metabolism.  it
promotes nitrogen retention, growth of
cartilage, transportation of amino acids
through the cell wall, and incorporation of
amino acids into protein.  this factor mo-
bilizes free fatty acids from adipose tissue
and increases the serum concentration of
these substances; long-term administration
of this hormone is followed by depletion of
body fat stores and inhibition of fatty acid
synthesis.  in diabetic subjects growth hor-
mone administration is followed by hyper-
glycemia, glycosuria, and ketosis; its effect
on carbohydrate metabolism in normal sub-
jects is more subtle.  sodium, potassium, and
inorganic phosphate are retained following
the administration of growth hormone.
hypercalciuria also accompanies such treat-
ment, an effect mediated through the para-
thyroid glands.
human growth hormone may be detected
in the serum through the use of the radio-
immunoassay.  the hypothalamus is inti-
mately involved with the control of the
secretion and release of growth hormone
from the pituitary.  there is a correlation
between the availability of glucose for me-
tabolism and the plasma concentration of
growth hormone; when glucose is unavail-
able growth hormone is released in order to
provide a substitute source of energy, fatty
acids.
the administration of growth hormone
to the patient with hypopituitarism is fol-
lowed by growth in many instances, but it
has not usually been effective in promoting
growth in individuals with other abnormali-
ties.  acquired resistance to the effect of
growth hormone is accompanied by the de-
velopment of antibodies directed against
this protein.

bone growth and metabolic studies of premature
infants treated with human growth hormone
the influence of exogenous human
growth hormone on growth and metabo-
lism of premature infants was observed.
it was not possible to register any in-
crease of linear bone growth after hormone
administration; concomitantly urinary hy-
droxyproline excretion did not change
significantly.
nitrogen balance studies indicated a
sharp increase of nitrogen retention, due to
a reduced urinary excretion, in all infants.
calcium and phosphorus balances rose in
three out of four premature infants treated
with growth hormone, but the characteris-
tic sth calciuric action of sth was not
observed.  furthermore, sth failed to in-
duce any significant increase in nefa
serum concentration of premature infants.
it may therefore be concluded that the
metabolic response of premature infants to
sth differs consistently from that normally
observed in more mature subjects.

growth hormone action on rat liver rna
polymerase
the effect of growth hormone on the activity of the
rna polymerase measured in this system is shown in
table 2.  it can be seen that hypophysectomy of the rat
results in decreased activity of the rna polymerase and
that the injection of 1 mg of human growth hormone into
the rat 12 h before death increased the enzyme activity
both in hypophysectomized rats and in normal rats.
however, the stimulating effect of growth hormone was
only seen in the absence of high concentrations of ammon-
ium sulphate; raising the ionic strength of the assay
medium abolished the growth hormone effect.  it should be
mentioned that addition of growth hormone in vitro in the
presence or absence of ammonium sulphate has had no
significant effect on the labelling of the rna by the
nuclear preparations.

mammary growth in rats treated with somatotropin during

graded increments (0.5-3.0 mg) of sth
every 6 days during both pregnancy and
lactation.  other groups of rats served as

gland deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) content
was determined in all rats and milk yield
was determined in all rats carried to day
14 postpartum.  significant increases in mam-
mary dna occurred in all rats treated with
sth irrespective of dose or schedule of in-
jections when compared to gestation controls.
a significant elevation in mammary dna
above the lactation control level was also
evident in rats receiving the hormone and
carried to day 14 of lactation.  milk yield
of rats treated with graded increments of
sth was significantly greater than that of
control lactators but milk yield of rats re-
ceiving a constant daily dose of the hormone
did not differ from that of controls.

growth retardation accompanying diabetes insipidus: an additional
mechanism?
from the above considerations, we may divide patients with nephrogenic
diabetes insipidus into at least two categories: (1) those who fail to respond
to currently available therapeutic products as well as to their own presumably
normal secretion of adh; (2) those with similar similar unresponsiveness to
treatment but with presumably reduced secretion of adh.  the adh-growth hormone
theory may well account in part for growth retardation in the later group.

studies on growth hormone secretion
in rats with the hypophysis autotransplanted
to the kidney capsule
the secretory capacity of the pituitary gland, autotransplanted to the
kidney capsule, was studied with special regard to the secretion of growth
hormone (gh).  body weight, body length, tibial epiphyseal width and
the mammary gland development after testosterone stimulation were
studied.
body growth and tibial epiphyseal width were markedly reduced in the
rats with transplanted hypophysis, but not as much as in the hypophys-
ectomized controls.  after injections of 0.25 mg testosterone propionate
daily for 10 days, only a few groups of alveoli were seen in the mam-
mary glands of the transplanted rats.  these observations show that there
is a considerable deficiency of gh in rats with the pituitary gland auto-
transplanted to the kidney capsule.  however, the development of a few
alveoli in the mammary glands is in favour of the theory that a small
amount of gh is secreted from the transplanted pituitary tissue.
injections of a purified vasopressin preparation (pitressin) in the rats
with autotransplanted hypophysis did not influence body growth, tibial
epiphyseal width or mammary gland development.  further, no effect of
pitressin was seen on the tibial epiphyseal cartilage of rats with intact
pituitary gland as has been reported by del vecchio et al. (1958) and
hiroshige & itoh (1960).  these experiments therefore do not support the
view that vasopressin acts as a gh releasing factor.

the effect of human growth hormone in
hypopituitary dwarfism
human growth hormone (hgh) raben has been
used in a dosage of 2 mg./m.2/day or 5 mg./m.2 twice
weekly.  this dosage is probably in or below, but
certainly not above, the range of physiological
replacement therapy.
in a standardized five-day metabolic hgh test
hypopituitary dwarfs retain more n than children
without gh deficiency.  this test is valuable
diagnostic help in hypopituitary dwarfism.
a prolonged treatment with hgh accelerates
growth in hypopituitary dwarfs but not in children
without gh deficiency.  growth rate, induced by
this treatment, is first above average and later average
or below average for age.  this decreasing response
to hgh is typical for the general phenomenon of
catch-up growth and is not caused by the develop-
ment of antibodies.
of 9 hypopituitary dwarfs, treated for at least 9
months, 3 were growth resistant from the beginning
in spite of a high n retention in the preceding hgh
test.  this resistance is caused by the development
of high titres of specific hgh antibodies in the very
first few months of treatment.  these antibodies
suppress the effect of hgh both on metabolism and
on growth.  the unexpected occasional induction in
man of antibodies against a homologous protein
hormone is of great interest.  the possibility that
these antibodies might be active not only against the
homogenous but also against the endogenous hormone
could have a far-reaching biological importance.

effects of short term administration of
hysiological doses of human growth hormone
in three patients with turner's syndrome
h. e. sjoberg
the effect of apparently physiological doses of human growth hormone
was investigated in three patients with turner's syndrome in short term
metabolic balance studies.  the subjects presented an abnormal sex chro-
mosome constitution and an increased level of sulphation factor activity
in serum.
two dose levels of hormone were used, and there appeared an anabolic
response to both.  no correlation with dose was obtained for any of the
parameters used except for urinary magnesium, where the retention was
greater with the higher dose.  the sulphation factor activity of serum in-
creased during hormone administration in the one case studied in this
respect.
the urinary excretion of hydroxyproline was within the normal range in
the two patients studied in this respect, and was not altered by growth
hormone.
all patients had an increased urinary excretion of creatine which at
present cannot be explained.  the creatinuria diminished during growth
hormone treatment.
the mechanism behind the retarded growth is discussed.  it is suggested
that a major factor might be a defect in the center for linear growth,
i.e. the epiphyses that would make these less responsive to all the factors
normally stimulating the growth processes in the epiphyseal zones.

the role of growth hormone and certain other endocrine factors in re-

hormone administration in doses of 0.5 to 5.0 ug/day (ovine nih) restore
the enzyme activity towards normal.  a bioassay for growth hormone is
suggested based on the determination of the total kidney transamidinase.
intact mice that had been given relatively large doses of triiodothyronin

influence of hormones on tumor growth and plasma prolactin levels in rats
bearing a pituitary "mammotropic" tumor
the effects of estradiol, cortisol acetate, thyroxine, or thiouracil on
tumor growth, organ weights, and plasma prolactin levels were determined
in rats bearing a furth pituitary "mammotropic" tumor (mtt.f4).  this
tumor is known to secrete large amounts of adrenocorticotropin, somatotropin,
and prolactin, but no follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone,
or thyrotropin.  at the dose levels used, estradiol significantly suppressed
tumor growth without influencing body growth, and it partially inhibited
enlargement of the adrenals and atrophy of the thymus.  cortisol acetate
significantly reduced both tumor and body growth.  thyroxine had no significant
effect on tumor growth but enhanced the somatotropic effect as indicated by
increases in body growth and organ weights.  thiouracil had no significant
effect on tumor or body growth, although it significantly increased thyroid
weight.  estradiol, cortisol acetate, and thyroxine each increased the plasma
prolactin levels of the tumor-bearing rats.

studies with human growth hormone
ten dwarfed patients whose short stature was of
varying aetiology were studied by investigation of
some of the metabolic effects of human growth
hormone, 10 mg. being administered daily for a
period of 5 to 9 days.  the patients were maintained
on a constant diet during a preliminary control
period, while receiving hgh, and in 7 patients from
2 to 7 days in the post-hgh period.  hgh produced
a reduction in serum cholesterol, with a
rebound on withdrawal, in 7; a delayed clearance of
fat from the blood after a fat load in 9; and the
appearance of pre-b lipoprotein in the fasting state,
as measured by paper electrophoresis, in all of them.
the fall in serum cholesterol and the rebound on
withdrawal of hgh has some relevance to the
observation that hypercholesterolaemia occurs in
some hypopituitary patients even in the absence of
hypothyroidism.
no change was observed in tests of thyroid and
adrenocortical function during the short-term high
dosage administration of hgh.
hypopituitary patients show a considerable
retention of nitrogen on hgh administration, and
we have confirmed the work of prader and his
colleagues that this provides a valuable diagnostic
test for growth hormone deficiency.  the measurement
of urinary nitrogen excretion after the withdrawal
of hgh also promises to be a useful investigation
in the differential diagnosis of short stature.
nitrogen excretion in the withdrawal phase in
hypopituitary children returns slowly to its pre-hgh
levels; two non-hypopituitary dwarfed
children excreted much more nitrogen in the withdrawal
period than they retained in the hgh
period.  one primordial dwarf showed a negligible
change in urinary nitrogen excretion both in the
hgh and in the post-hgh periods.

in the rat of the new model amino acid,
1-aminocyclopentanecarboxylic acid-1-c14.  although
the total tissue concentrations of this
amino acid were considerably less than those
found previously for a-aminoisobutyric acid,
the changes produced by the hormones were
much the same for both amino acids.  hydrocortisone
elevated the liver level of 1-aminocyclopentanecarboxylic
acid within 2 hr.
bovine growth hormone accelerated entry of
the amino acid into both skeletal muscle and
liver of hypophysectomized rats within 1 hr.
testosterone propionate elevated its distribution
ratio in the kidney but not in skeletal
muscle, whereas b-estradiol significantly increased
uptake of the model amino acid only
by the immature uterus.  only growth hormone
produced a significant change in the serum
level of 1-aminocyclopentanecarboxylic acid
under the conditions used.

insulin and insulin antagonism
as i said earlier, no simple answer
has yet emerged from the large amount of
research that has been directed toward determining
the nature of the substance or substances
responsible for the diabetes-inducing
and insulin-antagonizing actions of the
anterior lobe of the pituitary gland, and to
ascertaining their mechanism of action.
growth hormone and corticotropin certainly
qualify, but so do any other factors that can increase the mobilization of fats
as plasma albumin-bound free fatty acids.  the idea
that the yet incompletely characterized insulin
antagonist in the pancreas may be
liberated into the blood under the influence
of growth hormone and may play a role in
the process by which growth hormone diminishes
the activity of insulin in promoting
the utilization of glucose is attractive to me,
but still remains to be confirmed.

relationships of growth hormone, steroids and relaxin in the
transformation of pubic joint cartilage to ligament in
hypophysectomized mice
the histological changes occurring
in the pubic joint of hormonally
treated intact or hypophysectomized mice
have been studied.  estrogen treatment resulted
in bone resorption and transformation
of the cartilage caps of the pubic bones to
fibrocartilage in intact mice but not in hypophysectomized
mice.  furthermore, relaxin
failed to influence the appearance of the pubic
joint of estrogen-primed hypophysectomized
mice, whereas it induced the development of
long interpubic ligaments in intact mice.
when growth hormone (sth) was administered
to hypophysectomized mice, the pubic
joints responded to estrogen with bone resorption
and transformation of the cartilage caps
to fibrocartilage.  sth treatment also restored
the ability of the pubic joint of hypophysectomized
mice to proliferate long interpubic ligaments
when estrogen and relaxin were administered.
progesterone specifically inhibited
ligament formation due to relaxin injection
without altering the histological changes
associated with estrogen treatment, both in
intact mice and in sth-maintained, hypophysectomized mice.

effect of testosterone propionate and growth hormone on
growth and chemical composition of muscle and other
tissues in hypophysectomized male rats
the effect of testosterone
propionate and growth hormone on the
growth of muscle, bone, pelt, viscera and
seminal vesicles was studied in hypophysectomized
male rats.  testosterone (0.1 mg/day)
stimulated growth in the levator ani muscle
and seminal vesicles but had no effect on the
other tissues studied.  growth hormone (0.1
mg/day) accelerated growth in all tissues
except the seminal vesicles.  testosterone did
not enhance the growth-promoting effect of
growth hormone in any tissue except the
levator ani muscle.  growth hormone stimulated
deposition of myosin, sarcoplasmic
proteins, collagen and alkali-soluble proteins
in the thigh muscle of hypophysectomized
rats.  the composition of the muscle in treated
and control hypophysectomized rats was the
same as that in normal rats.  growth hormone
also increased the collagen, keratin-clastin
and globular protein content of the pelt.  the
effect of growth hormone on the proteins of
muscle and pelt was not enhanced by testosterone.
testosterone given alone had no effect
on the chemical composition or content of the
muscle and pelt in hypophysectomized rats.

growth hormone and diabetes mellitus
since the advent of insulin the vascular and neurological
lesions have replaced ketoacidosis as the major
problem in diabetes.  although good control of hyperglycemia
and glycosuria with diet and insulin may
influence favorably the development of the ocular angiopathy,
there remains a high incidence of these
lesions with resulting blindness despite such good
control.
growth hormone may be a major factor in the
pathophysiology of diabetes mellitus and its effects
may be a reflection of the genetic disturbance.  its importance
was first realized by the classical experiments
of houssay and those of young which revealed its
diabetogenic effects in experimental animals.  the association
of acromegaly with diabetes has been for a
long time the major argument in support of the hypothesis
of the diabetogenic effect of growth hormone
in man.

experiments on the contribution of somatotrophin to prenatal growth in the rat
hypophyseoprivus in a fetal rat induced by decapitating the fetus in utero
retards fetal growth.  this effect can be prevented by injected somatotrophin.
these observations substantially support the view that in the normal rat
shortly before birth the fetal somatotrophin from the developing hypophysis
governs in part the prenatal growth which occurs at that time.  although
complete hypophysectomy of a pregnant rat retards
the growth of fetuses, the manner
of its action is obscure.  in an individual litter, combined hypophysectomy
of the mother and hypophyseoprivus in a fetus retards fetal growth but not
to any greater extent than hypophysectomy of the mother without
hypophyseoprivus in the fetus.  in the intact fetus injections of somatotrophin
(armour) do not accelerate fetal growth, presumably because ample fetal
somatotrophin from the developing hypophysis is present.
.I 600
.W
insulin and protein metabolism
the present status of protein synthesis within cells has
been outlined.  protein is formed in the absence of insulin;
the net formation of protein is accelerated by insulin.  the
effects of insulin on protein metabolism take place independently
of the transport of glucose or amino acids into the
cell; of glycogen synthesis; and of the stimulation of high
energy phosphate formation.  in the case of protein metabolism,
as in certain studies on the pathways of glucose and
fat metabolism, these observations reveal striking intracellular
effects of insulin in many tissues.  within most
tissues the effect of insulin appears to find expression predominantly
at the microsomal level.  incidentally, other
hormones which affect protein metabolism such as growth
or sex hormones appear to act at the microsomes.  the fact
that insulin exerts effects on protein metabolism at other
intracellular sites as well as the above independent effects
leads one to agree that its action consists of a stimulation
of multiple, seemingly unrelated, metabolic events.
the fact that an immediate effect of insulin on protein
synthesis is independent of the immediate need for extracellular
glucose or amino acids does not mean that the
sustained functioning of cells is likewise independent.  the
biochemist is fully aware of metabolic defects in diabetes
which are not altered by insulin in vitro, but which demand
varying periods of pretreatment of the animal.  it is
also known that in diabetes some proteins (enzymes) may
be deficient while others may be produced in excess in the
absence of insulin.
it is suggested that the physician desires at least two
kinds of relation between these fundamental studies and his
patients.  one is the possible relation of a deficiency of insulin
action to pathological processes in tissues which have
not as yet been examined by the methods described.  the
other is the need for more accurate measurements of the
metabolic disorder and its control than such things as
urinary and blood glucose.  in developing such future improvements,
the place of insulin in protein biosynthesis
must be kept in mind.

the influence of blood glucose on the plasma
concentration of growth hormone
a. berson, m.d.
a sensitive and specific assay method has been used to
demonstrate acute changes in plasma hgh in normal and diabetic subjects.
hgh secretion is suppressed by glucose administration
and markedly stimulated by hypoglycemia, by interference
with intracellular glucose utilization.  high levels of hgh
were also observed during prolonged fasting, after exercise,
and four to six hours following oral glucose administration.
abnormalities in hgh secretion were found in association
with acromegaly and obesity, and following section of the
hypophyseal stalk.
the half time for disappearance of endogenous plasma
hgh is twenty to thirty minutes.

failure to thrive: the diencephalic syndrome of infancy and childhood
we have presented a case of a patient with an
astrocytoma of the optic chiasm who demonstrated
the features of the "diencephalic" or
"failure-to-thrive" syndrome.  overactivity, overalertness
and emaciation were significant symptoms
in this patient.  roentgenograms characteristically
demonstrate normal bone growth,
good muscular outline, and absent subcutaneous
fat.  increased growth hormone was found and
may be a factor in the disturbed lipid metabolism.
.I 603
.W
increased stature
the fact that some patients respond to growth-hormone
administration with linear growth does not indicate growth-hormone
deficiency or hypopituitarism.  yet this appears to
be the main factor that led these authors to assume that
their patients were suffering from hypopituitarism.  the
conclusion that children with growth retardation should be
subjected to a short trial period of treatment with growth
hormone to single out those who are deficient in growth hormone
is therefore of questionable validity.
rather, because of the limited supply of human growth
hormone, it appears that much more stringent criteria for
administration of human growth hormone should be advocated.
every effort should be made to uncover the patients
who might benefit from growth hormone by utilizing reliable
tests of pituitary function and perfecting a suitable growth-hormone
assay.  those who have more than suggestive evidence
of hypopituitarism and growth-hormone deficiency
should then be treated and carefully evaluated for response
after long-term treatment.

on language disorders in young children: a reorganization of thinking
current questions and confusions about
the use of the term aphasia with reference
to young children seem often to
reflect semantic problems accruing
from professional habits of thinking in
terms of etiologic and pathologic labels.
it is argued that if the term aphasia is
generalized simply to refer to inabilities
or interferences in the development of
language comprehension and use, then
it is the task of an evaluating group to
describe as well as possible, and in detail,
the specific impairments of function
in each child.  this task commonly
requires the use of an extensive period
of "diagnostic teaching," wherein care
is taken to explore which sensory and
motor modalities are working and
which are not, and whether integration
of various stimuli is taking place.
some current ideas are discussed with
reference to descriptions of impairment,
causal factors that are fairly unique in
childhood, some thoughts about the
neurophysiology of the human "language
system," and some psychosocial
factors important for language-learning.
special attention is given to various relations,
in terms of temporal resolving
power, between sensation and sensory
integration.  a scheme, or model, is suggested
which may prove fruitful for
experimental design in attacking some
of these problems at a prelanguage or
premeaning level.  it is argued that the
proportion of "unknowns" can be reduced
by careful study based on information
about impaired functions within the sensory-integrative-motor complex,
without particular regard for "site and
extent of lesion."

therapy for hearing-impaired children
in comparison with the u.s.a. and
europe, canada is still in the early
stages of developing rehabilitative services
for speech and hearing-impaired
children and adults.  they are available
in some large canadian cities, but in
the opinion of the authors, these services
and more should be made available
to the hearing impaired of every canadian community.
specialists in the rehabilitation of
communication problems, along with
members of other medical, paramedical and social services, recognize
the vast variety of communication
problems that can occur in persons
of all ages, the tremendous handicap
that such problems represent to the
individual, the loss that such handicapped
persons represent to our society
and the pressing need for efficient and
effective rehabilitation.  more practically,
it is hoped that this article has
made its readers more aware of the
vast variety of rehabilitative procedures
available today for the hearing
impaired.  with a better understanding
of the problems of defective hearing,
it is hoped that all readers, professional
and non-professional, will join
in mutual support for the establishment
of these vitally needed services
in their respective communities.

flap surgery was performed on each patient after speech therapy was

following the surgery.  the youngest child, a first grader, realized normal
speech following the surgery and therapy.  the two other children continue

stimulus overload, action cycles, and the completion gradient
systematic inquiries into the origin of certain emotional disturbances
of infants show that consistent maternal care is vital for the
child's normal physical, psychic, and social development, indeed,
for his survival.  the most elementary precondition for consistent
maternal care is the physical presence of the mother or her substitute.
it has, however, become increasingly apparent that children's
development can also be stunted, and that they suffer damage of
varying extent by the attention of, and close contact with, a mother
who dispenses what seems to be the "wrong kind of mothering".
a model of the mother-baby interaction is proposed to explicate
the dynamics of the "wrong kind of mothering" and its
consequences: my proposition is that the mutual exchanges between
mother and baby consist in a give and take of action and
reaction between the two partners, which requires from each
of them both active and passive responses.  these responses form
series and chains, the single links of which consist in what i call
"action cycles," each completed in itself and at the same time
anticipating the next link.  i designated these seriated response
exchanges as the "precursor of dialogue," as a primal dialogue.
the dialogue acts as a vector of the baby's development,
influencing its direction and stimulating it to adaptive efforts and
psychic growth.  it follows that inappropriate mothering (quantitatively
as well as qualitatively) results in what is referred to at
this time as the "derailment" of the primal dialogue.
controlled experiments with animals, findings of experimental
psychology, and, lastly, clinical findings illustrate the
mechanics of the derailed dialogue and its sequelae.
in the cases under review a surfeit of stimulation, a psychic
overloading, resulted in the derailment of dialogue.  overloading
prevents its subject from completing actions or responses initiated
by him.  long-lasting overload results in the cumulation of "incompleted
action cycles".  the sequelae of this cumulation are
profound changes in the behavior of the individual.  these changes
are manifested in a departure from the norms of individual and
social behavior patterns that are maladaptive for the individual
and asyntonic with his society, that is, asocial.
the derailment of the dialogue is triggered, perhaps even
caused,
by the nature of the social setting.  one setting, over-population,
is extensively discussed in connection with an animal
experiment, and the implications for the human community are
examined.

children at kelbourne
kelbourne school, glasgow, which educates both
spastic and aphasic children, is the first school of its
kind to be administered by a local education authority.
its aphasic department, largely experimental in nature,
contains children aged three to eight.  in the spastics
department there are 45 children with severe physical
handicaps and their ages range from 3 to 16.
the school, which celebrated its golden jubilee last year,
has its origins in the maryhill hall public school for
defective and epileptic children which opened in 1907
with 12 pupils in premises of which, as an h.m.i. reported
four years later, 'it was impossible to speak favourably'.
the report continued, 'a public hall, used frequently in
the evenings for public entertainments, lacking proper
cloakrooms, bare in appearance, and generally comfortless,
should not be used for this purpose'.  the inspector's
words did not go unheeded and seven years later the
children were transferred with others to the new buildings
of percy street special school.  in the 1950s the name was
changed to kelbourne school.
between and through two world wars the school
provided education for physically and mentally handicapped
children but in 1955 a new unit was added and
spastic children were admitted for the first time.
gradually the emphasis shifted from children with other
physical and mental handicaps to the cerebrally palsied
and finally the entire building became available for
spastics.  two years ago the aphasic children joined the
school.  miss e.f. hamilton is the headmistress.

deafness
methods of detection, diagnosis, and management of deafness

naturally from this knowledge.

pharyngoplasty in speech
where adequate palate repair is undertaken at 1 year there is no indication
for pharyngoplasty as well at that age.
pharyngoplasty is indicated as a "supportive" operation only when the
result of the palate repair can be assessed (5 years plus), and where the
speech result proves disappointing.
the figure of 171 pharyngoplastics in 944 cases applies to the known speech
results up to april 1963.  it follows that with follow-up of the more recent
primary cases pharyngoplasty may well be necessary in some.
the hynes pharyngoplasty has proved to be the most satisfactory.

verbal effects in the intermediate-size transportation problem
preschool children were given an intermediate-size discrimination problem,
told before each response that the reward was under the "medium" stimulus:
and 1- and 3-step transposition tests.  during training, group i was
group ii was told that it was "not under the big or little one"; and group
iii was not told anything.  the verbalizations were not given during the
tests.  groups i and ii learned the initial discrimination faster than group
iii, and transposed more than group iii, but there was a distance effect
in all three groups.  these results, and other data, suggest that the
deficiency in the verbal control over motor behavior in young children arises
from deficiencies in both the decoding and encoding processes.

want to have the emotional problems dealt with in this manner rather

the formation of a cleft palate unit- a preliminary report

ironically the problem of congenital defects increases as

acquisition of language
although the work of bullowa, jones, and bever has some of its greatest
promise in the light it may shed on the development of functions of language
in children, the promise cannot be realized unless the authors give
a great deal of explicit attention to the framework of such analysis, for there
is not, as may be the case for phonological and grammatical development,
anything like a satisfactory body of linguistic theory and method as to the
terminal state.  while a good deal may be learned without such a theory, and
necessarily must be so learned, since the work in progress cannot be suspended
until such an unpredictable millenium, it still would be a pity if the
chance were lost for the interaction of the acquisition of data and the
improvement of theoretical notions.
let me complete my discussion by developing my argument in two
ways: (a) by briefly stating the nature of the problem with regard to the
terminal state of verbal development, (b) and by indicating what present
and future contribution such fields as anthropology, sociology, and social
psychology may be able to make to the solution of the problem.

the speech production and spoken language of the deaf
the distinction was made between speech production and spoken language in

studies in both areas was undertaken, including the report of a new electronic
visual monitoring device, the glossal transducer.  it was postulated that the
deaf utilise a unique visual-to-motor conversion within the brain when speaking
and monitor conscously by tactile-kinaesthetic control.  the more recent
studies relate to the syntactical features of the speech of the deaf.  these
show that deafness creates telegraphic speech with reduced sentence length and
omissions of essential words such as functors.  the speech of the deaf seems to
contain mostly nouns and verbs, with a limited number of words used to expand
verb forms.

cognitive functioning in early infantile autism: an examination of four cases
by means of the wechsler intelligence scale for children
the results are communicated which were obtained from an examination,
by means of the wechsler intelligence scale for children, of four cases of
early infantile autism.  these cases had developed in such a way that a
reliable investigation by means of a mental test had become possible.
according to their full scale iq's the four cases fell within the category of
dull normal intelligence or less.  all of them showed a considerable
discrepancy between the verbal and the performance iq, the performance iq being
of much higher value.  the composition of the autistic test profiles was
characterized by a large variability in the subtest scores, discriminating the
autistic group significantly from non-autistic control groups.  the subtest
score divergencies, responsible for the large variability, showed a distinct
pattern, being specific for the autistic group as a whole.  this group could
be considered as a distinct group particularly by a marked tendency to achieve
poorly and far below the subject's average level in the subtests comprehension
and vocabulary, and to achieve superiorly and far above that level in the
subtests block design and object assembly.  by specifying the mental functions,
conditional for success in these four subtests that occupy extreme positions
within the autistic test profiles, it was concluded that the autistic patients
apparently were able to achieve well, or even superiorly, only if the task
could be performed on a purely perceptual level.  but they failed as soon as
an appeal was made to thinking proper.  this was thought to be due to a
disability in dealing with imaginary things and imaginary situations, or,
in other words, to an incapability to objectify what is not actually present
in the subject's concrete situation.  it is proposed that this impairment
could be reduced to a lack of symbolic means, being the correlate of a
defective or insufficiently developed language in the patients.  it is further
proposed that children suffering from early
infantile autism might not be able,
or at a later stage only, to reach that level of language development in which
words can be used as symbols,
representing absent things and absent situations.

congenital heart disease, deaf-mutism and associated somatic malformations
occurring in several members of one family
m.d. and patrick h. lehan, m.d.
a unique family is described in which the

to the pulmonary valvular stenosis, idiopathic
hypertrophic subaortic stenosis.  all the affected

genetic and nongenetic factors and
their role in the development of the malformations
are discussed.  it is suggested that the cardiac
defect is transmitted by a single non-sex-linked

inheritance).  in the presence of a normal karyotype

histidinemia
a review of published reports of
histidinemia indicates that this condition
has a variability of clinical and biochemical
expression.  three children with histidinemia,
born of a consanguineous marriage
are reported here.  they had blond hair,
blue eyes, speech defects, mental retardation,
and a peculiar eeg abnormality.  they
also exhibited characteristic biochemical
findings of the disease: elevated blood and
urine histidine, increased urine imidazolepyruvic
acid, and a sustained high rise in
plasma histidine following an oral histidine
tolerance test.  they did not, however, have
the reduction of skin histidine a-deaminase
activity which has been observed in some
children with this condition.  tests for determination
of heterozygotes in the family
were not successful.
parental consanguinity and normal skin
a-deaminase activity set these children apart
from other reported cases.  the first lends
support to the hypothesis that histidinemia
is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait;
the second supports the idea that the genic
fault which results in reduced histidine a-
deaminase activity can be expressed to a
different degree in different tissues.  these
children seem to represent a variant of
histidinemia where liver histidase activity is
reduced while skin histidase activity is
present.

interpretation within the metaphor
analytic investigation of the use of the metaphor was first given impetus
by ella freeman sharpe (1950), who explored the symbolic
meaning of particular metaphoric phrases with reference to the body
and libidinal needs.  currently, interest has become focused upon the
use of the metaphor as a self-conscious, rational therapeutic technique
of communication, of particular value with those patients who have
reached "the borderline of sanity".  ekstein (1961) and ekstein and
wallerstein (1957) have emphasized that the use of the metaphor
should be regarded as an essential technique for gradually establishing
communication and initial insight with borderline and schizophrenic
patients but that it must not be regarded as a treatment technique
in itself.  it is but a preliminary approximation to the final therapeutic
act, which ultimately will consist of a classical interpretation
at the level of the secondary process.  the use of the metaphor derives
its primary value from maintaining contact with patients who are
constantly in danger of being inundated by a break-through of primary-
process material.

evolution of a characteristic speech disorder in
juvenile cerebral lipidosis
juvenile cerebral lipidosis is being diagnosed with increasing frequency in
this country, especially in schools for the visually handicapped.  the
manifestations of rapidly developing loss of vision, seizures, muscular
rigidity, ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa and eeg abnormalities are well known in
this disorder.  a speech disorder described as a "lolling, stammering speech"
was mentioned by sjogren (1931) in his comprehensive description
of juvenile amaurotic idiocy, but this has not been emphasized in
recent descriptions.  this report, based upon an analysis of 5 cases,
describes the evolution of a characteristic form of speech pathology that
is invariably present in juvenile cerebral lipidosis.
the initial speech abnormality seen early in the disorder is a hesitancy of
speech and occasional repetition of words.  in time, dysarthria becomes
evident with slurring, nasality and impairment of phonation similar to that
seen in pseudobulbar palsy.  in addition to the dysarthria, a highly
characteristic perseverative speech appears which often has a close resemblance
to true stuttering.  this stuttering-like speech has been observed in 4 of the
5 cases at some time during the course of their illnesses.  as the speech
patterns deteriorate, the patient becomes less communicative and finally lapses
into mutism.  the speech disorder is often the most disabling aspect of this
syndrome.

when maxillary anterior teeth are missing, either congenitally, naturally
(as in the mixed dentition period), or because of neglect, the upper lip
may appear to be rolled under the premaxilla.  the lower lip usually
assumes a characteristic 'pouty' appearance.
this complex of tissue deformities also may be important in the articulation
of speech sounds.  fricatives and plosives are difficult to produce
correctly because of the malposition of the lip.  there may be interference
with direction of air current, contact of tongue to alveolar ridge, and
normal contact of lips.
corrective procedures are designed to improve the labial profile and to
establish more normal relationships of intraoral structures.  these
procedures, employed individually or in combination, may include othodontic
movement of maxillary segments, dental prosthesis, and cheiloplasty.
another more recently developed adjunct involves autogenous
osscous implantation in the cleft areas.

heterogeneity of the 'cleft palate population' and research designs
the primary point made in this paper is that we must reject the notion
that there is some inherent, universal commonality among individuals
who are born with a cleft lip and/or cleft palate.  we must recognize the
various pertinent subgroups within this population.  this does not mean,
however, that one must always recognize the smallest subgroup in doing a
given study.  on the contrary, we would defend the use of fewest possible
subgroups consistent with the specific research purpose.  nevertheless, we
feel that time spent considering the purposes of a study and the subgroups
which need to be identified will tend to minimize the number of
contradictory results, and will assist us in the interpretation of the
observations that our insight and technology make possible.

cineradiographic comparison of normal to noncleft subjects with velopharyngeal

cineradiographic studies of the normal subjects were compared with
studies of noncleft subjects who demonstrated velopharyngeal inadequacy.
the following conclusions were made: a) there was a significant difference
between soft palate length in normals and the velopharyngeal inadequacy
group.  b) there was not a significant difference between depth of nasopharynx
in normal and the velopharyngeal inadequacy group.  c) the
difference of the means of the soft palate length and depth of nasopharynx
between the normals and velopharyngeal inadequacy group was significant.
d) the thickness of the soft palate was greater in the normal than the
abnormal group.  e) in 70% of the normal and velopharyngeal inadequacy
groups the height of soft palate elevation was above the palatal plane.   f)
in 80% of the normal group the height of velopharyngeal closure took
place below the palatal plane.  none of the subjects in the velopharyngeal
inadequacy group obtained velopharyngeal closure.  g) there was no significant
correlation between amount of gap and voice quality.  h) there was
no significant correlation between amount of gap and intelligibility of
speech.  i) there was a difference between vital capacity readings for the
velopharyngeal inadequacy group with nose occluded and unoccluded.  j)

spontaneous verbal rehearsal in a memory task as a function of age
a distinction is made between 2 alternative hypotheses for explaining an
often-reported deficiency in verbally mediated performance during early
childhood: (1) the verbal response is made, but tends not to mediate
performance ("mediational-deficiency hypothesis"); (2) the verbal response
tends not to be made ("production-deficiency hypothesis").  a study is
described which attempts to meet the ideal criteria for a test of the
production-deficiency hypothesis.  the method used was that of direct
observation of s's spontaneous verbalizations, and the hypothesis was confirmed
by the finding that kindergarteners are less likely than older children to
rehearse stimulus names in a nonverbal serial recall task.

early experience and the socialization of cognitive modes in children
this paper deals with the question: what is cultural deprivation and how
does it act to shape and depress the resources of the human mind?  the
arguments presented are: first, that the behavior which leads to social,
educational, and economic poverty is socialized in early childhood; second,
that the central quality involved in the effects of cultural deprivation is a
lack of cognitive meaning in the mother-child communication system; and, third,
that the growth of cognitive processes is fostered in family control systems
which offer and permit a wide range of alternatives of action and thought and
that such growth is constricted by systems of control which offer predetermined
solutions and few alternatives for consideration and choice.
the research group was composed of 160 negro mothers and their
4-year-old children selected from four different social status levels.
the data are presented to show social status differences among the
four groups with respect to cognitive functioning and linguistic codes and
to offer examples of relations between maternal and child behavior that are
congruent with the general lines of argument laid out.

recovery of mycoplasmas in the study of
human leukaemia and other malignancies
numerous reports have been published concerning the
necessity of testing for the presence of mycoplasmas before
the interpretation of experiments performed in cell
cultures.  such tests are especially important when
the presence of viruses is suspected, since recent evidence
indicates that some mycoplasmas are capable of eliciting
a transmissible cytopathic effect.
in addition, some mycoplasmas and viruses share
properties, such as size, filterability, morphology in
electron microscopy, sensitivity to ether, ability to
haemagglutinate and cause haemadsorption, interference
with virus replication in vitro, lack of inhibition by certain
commonly used antibiotics and inhibition of growth by
homologous antiserum.  thus, the absence of ordinary
bacteria and moulds in preparations eliciting a cytopathic
effect in cell cultures is an unreliable criterion for viral
identification.  great caution should be exercised in
classifying new agents as viruses, especially as myxo-
viruses, without adequate testing to exclude their identity
as mycoplasmas.

pneumonia due to mycoplasma pneumoniae
its incidence in the membership of a co-operative medical group
ruth mcmahan, edmund r. clarke, william a. maccoll, and j. thomas grayston
a total of 1051 cases of pneumonia occurred in
72,992 persons who were members of a medical
co-operative in the period december 1, 1963, to
december 31, 1964.  the annual rate of pneumonia
was 12.9 per 1000.  isolation of mycoplasma pneumoniae
from throat swabs was attempted in over
half the cases reported, and paired blood specimens
were obtained in one third.  on the basis of laboratory
examination of these specimens, the incidence
of clinically recognized pneumonia due to m. pneumoniae
was between 1 and 1.5 persons per 1000
per year.
although peak rates of pneumonia occurred under
five years of age (45 per 1000) pneumonia due to m.
pneumoniae was uncommon in this age group.  it
was most common in children five to nine years old,
and was frequently the cause of pneumonia in adolescents
(ten to nineteen years of age).  the rates in
children in primary school was twice the average
incidence.  m. pneumoniae pneumonia also differed
from the pneumonias of other etiology in that it
occurred throughout the year, with no seasonal excess
whereas total pneumonia showed a predominance
in winter.
the typical clinical syndrome of the pneumonias
in which m. pneumoniae was isolated was one of
prominent systemic manifestations of headache and
fever, but few respiratory symptoms occurred except
cough.  upper-respiratory-tract complaints and an
elevated white-cell count were much more frequent
in the other pneumonias.  the patients with m.
pneumoniae pneumonia were almost never hospitalized
but suffered significant absenteeism.  they
came from larger families, usually with children of
school age.  reporting physicians were usually correct
in diagnosing these pneumonias as "atypical" or "viral."

establishment of a turkey flock free of 'n' strain mycoplasma
mycoplasma of the 'n' strain are frequently isolated from
turkey poults affected with airsacculitis but free of
mycoplasma gallisepticum.  research on the 'n' strain has
been impeded by the presence of a high proportion of
turkey poults with airsacculitis in all breeding flocks
examined, by the difficulty of culturing and identifying
the mycoplasma strains, and by the lack of a practical
serologic test.  this communication describes the establishment
of a small nucleus of 'n'-free turkeys from a commercial
breeding flock known to carry 'n' mycoplasma.
hens and toms for the production of 'n'-free poults were

some intraspecies differences in antigens on
the surface of certain living human cells
surface antigens of several types of living cells of human
origin were partially characterized with hyperimmune antisera prepared in
the rabbit against living hela cells and living, uncultured, full-term, human
amnion cells.  hemagglutination, mixed-agglutination, and direct and
indirect immunofluorescence (fab) techniques were employed.  with
these techniques and fractional absorption procedures, common and specific
cell antigens were detected on the surface of several human living cells:
uncultured and primary amnion, two established human cell lines (rp am 1
and u amnion) of presumed normal origin and two (hela and hep-2) of
presumed malignant origin, and human erythrocytes.  none of the antigens
were found on nctc 2555 mouse cells.  the human cells possessed species-
related antigens demonstrable by hemagglutination.  after removal of
the hemagglutinins by absorption with human erythrocytes, antibody in high
titer for the homologous cells was detected by fab methods.  in addition,
some changes in antigens on the surface of amnion cells during primary
culture were observed.  finally, an antigen was found on hela and hep-2
cells, by use of anti-hela serum absorbed with human erythrocytes and rp
am 1 cells, that was not found on either human erythrocytes, uncultured
amnion cells, or on the cells of the two established amnion cell lines.  at
the dilutions used in the tests, antibodies to the abo blood group isoanti-
gens, forssman hapten, or adsorbed serum proteins could not account for
the antigens detected.  the possibility that mycoplasma sp. antigens
were responsible for the reactions was inconsistent with the results.  the
specificity of the fab methods on living cells was confirmed.

serological relationships among human mycoplasmas as shown
by complement-fixation and gel diffusion
and robert m. chanock
antigenic relationships among human
mycoplasmas were studied by complement-
fixation and agar gel diffusion techniques.  four
recognized human species.  mycoplasma hominis
type 1, m. hominis type 2, m. salivarium, and
m. fermentans were antigenically distinct in
these tests.  in addition, m. pneumoniae (eaton
agent, the etiological agent of cold agglutinin-
positive atypical pneumonia) was different from
these four species.  although these species were
distinct, evidence of shared antigenic components
was obtained in complement-fixation and agar
gel diffusion tests.  since rabbits were immunized
with mycoplasmas grown in rabbit muscle infu-
sion broth supplemented with rabbit serum or,
in the case of m. pneumoniae, with infected chick
embryo lung suspension, the possibility that the
heterologous reactions resulted from antibody
to growth medium components could be excluded.
four recent mycoplasma isolates from the oro-
pharynx were analyzed, and three were shown to
be closely related to m. hominis type 1, and the
fourth was closely related to m. salivarium.
although the recent isolates could not be dis-
tinguished from the related "prototype" human
species by complement-fixation, differences could
be detected by the agar gel diffusion technique.

mammalian cell cultures contaminated with

ii. effect of pplo on cell morphology in established
monolayer cultures
the occurrence of cytopathogenic changes in monolayer cultures of
pplo-contaminated mammalian cells has been shown to be related to
deficiency of arginine in the medium.  the same effects were seen when the
cell culture medium was depleted by pplo prior to application to pplo-free
cell cultures even though viable pplo were no longer present.  the fact that
the same picture resulted in the absence of pplo when either arginine or
glucose were omitted from the medium would indicate that, while the defi-
ciency created under the conditions described was specific, the cellular
changes could as well be the result of omission or depletion of other mam-
malian cell growth requirements.  the importance of surveillance of cell
lines for the presence of pplo to avoid misinterpretation of cytopathogenic
effects was stressed.

suppression of rous sarcoma virus growth in tissue

virus (rav) was inhibited in wi-26, wi-38, and chick-embryo fibroblasts
infected with this mycoplasma.  the mycoplasma isolate, designated strain 941,
reacted strongly in the complement-fixation test with antiserum to mycoplasma
orale ch19299, an isolate obtained from the human oral cavity.  the cytopathic
effect of mycoplasma strain 941 could be eliminated by growing the mycoplasma
on an artificial agar medium before inoculation into chick-embryo fibroblasts.
serial passage in chick-embryo fibroblasts restored the cytopathogenicity of
the agar-grown mycoplasma.  however, growth of rsv and rav was inhibited by
both the tissue culture-grown and the agar-grown 941 strain, and also by the
ch19299 strain which did not produce any cytopathic effect.

matic, and 2 had probably unrelated symptoms.  the

disease with a pure culture of pplo have been reported.  the possibi-

the serological differentiation of mycoplasma strains (pleuro-

a complement fixation test with rabbit antisera was used to differentiate 82
cultures of mycoplasma from man, mammalian cell cultures, laboratory rats and
mice, cattle, goats, poultry, embryonated eggs and sewage.
seventeen serotypes were distinguished, 5 from man, 1 from mammalian cell
cultures, 4 from rats and mice, 4 from cattle and goats, 2 from poultry and one
saprophytic.  most of these corresponded to recognized species of mycoplasma,
but 1 of human origin (represented by 1 strain, navel), and 1 from tissue
cultures (5 strains), may represent new species.  r38, one of the serotypes
from rats, could be distinguished from the species m. arthritidis, but is
probably an antigenic variant rather than a distinct species.  two species
hitherto recognized as distinct m. arthritidis and m. hominis type 2, could not
be distinguished and appear to constitute a single species.  these findings
illustrate the necessity, from the viewpoint of taxonomy, of comparing
mycoplasma strains by serological methods.
the serotypes of human and animal origin were largely host-specific.
exceptions were the inclusion of m. arthritidis from rats and m. hominis type 2
from man in a single serotype, the finding of a bovine organism among the
strains isolated from goats and of a saprophytic strain in a rat.
in relation to the aetiology of disease in man and animals, the isolation of
an endogenous mycoplasma from embryonated eggs used to passage infective
material illustrates the importance of identifying these organisms
serologically.  the demonstration of mixed mycoplasma infections in lesions
in two rats shows the necessity of adequately purifying all cultures of
mycoplasma before examination.

further observations of the lymphomas
of african children
during 1963, cytopathogenic, filtrable agents were frequently encountered in
cultures of embryonic human kidney cells following their inoculation with
supernatant fluids from primary human amnion cultures which had previously been
exposed to extracts of tumors and other specimens from east african children
with malignant lymphomas of the kind described by burkitt and others.  the
results seemed noteworthy because they suggested an intimate association
between the agents and the disease, and also because of the nature of the
isolations which involved two phenomena, an initial induction of a peculiar
spindling and twisting of the amnion cells
(fig. 1) and subsequently destructive changes
in kidney cells inoculated with fluid from such altered amnion cultures.  the
direct inoculation of embryonic kidney cells with extracts of tumors or bone
marrow never caused cytopathogenic effects nor did the isolated, transmissible
agents have the capacity to induce the amnion lesions.  nevertheless,
the two effects were closely associated and clearly related to the specimens.
the cytopathogenic agents were later cultivated on protein-rich media and
found to have the characteristics of mycoplasma.  they failed to induce
tumors in a variety of animals, and serologic tests in which they served as
antigen gave suggestive but inconclusive evidence of a relationship to the
disease.  the mycoplasma also failed to induce the amnion lesions caused by
the specimens.

pleuropneumonia-like organisms
despite their small size, the pplo carry
the full complement of the chemical com-
pounds and enzymes contained in larger
bacteria and in cells.  they contain both
dna and rna, and in their independent
metabolism they are essentially like other free
living cells in contrast to the viruses which
have no independent metabolism outside the
living host cell.  several strains of pplo have
been cultivated from the mucous membranes
of apparently normal human subjects, espe-
cially from the respiratory and urinary tracts.
until recently, however, definite evidence of
the association between the pplo and clear-
ly defined clinical disease in the human sub-
ject was lacking.  in 1962 it became evident
that the so-called eaton "virus," originally
isolated by eaton and his associates in 1944
from patients with primary atypical pneu-
monia, was in reality a pleuropneumonia-like
organism.  typical pplo colonies are pro-
duced on a cell-free agar medium which is
enriched by the addition of blood serum or
yeast.  a number of strains of pplo has now
been identified, and in recognition of their
unique characteristics, they have been classi-
fied in a separate order, the mycoplasmatales,

problems of disease of
parathyroid glands
if biochemical tests indicate unequivocally
that there is a functioning parathyroid tumour,
usually an adenoma, its removal will relieve
symptoms and prevent any further damage to
organs such as the kidneys.  in 80 per cent,
of such cases the operation is not particularly
difficult to anyone with experience of thyroid
surgery.  the tumour is seldom of great size,
usually less than half an inch in diameter, but
a careful search in the expected position, in
close apposition to the posterior surface of the
thyroid lobes, will usually reveal it.  such
adenomata are usually more brown in colour
than the normal yellow gland; but in some 20
per cent, of cases one or more of the glands
may be aberrant, or possibly absent, and super-
numerary glands may be present.  it is usually
one of the lower pair of glands which occupies
an ectopic position and, as i explained in the
outline of the embryological development, it
may accompany the thymus into the mediasti-
num, rather a vast area in which to seek a small
tumour.  such an exploration cannot be lightly
undertaken, but if the evidence is indisputable
the burden must be shouldered.  it is correct
policy, i believe, first to carry out a thorough
exploration of the neck, and if this proves un-
availing, to inspect the mediastinum through a
sternum-splitting incision some two weeks later,
rather than completing this major undertaking
at one session.

the age factor in experimental hypertension
of the dca type in rats
rats aged 25 and 86 days were sensibilised by unilateral nephrectomy and a week
later were given 1.1 mg/100 g dca every third day for 6 weeks and a 1% nacl
solution to drink.  the younger rats reacted with a greater increase in blood
pressure, more so male rats.  hypertrophy of the heart and kidneys and
mortality and supression of growth were also all more evident in the younger
age group.  only male rats given the steroid hormone starting from day 25
showed permanent suppression of growth.

response of a serum glycoprotein to tissue injury
and necrosis
1. the response to necrosis, hyperplasia and tumour growth
a serum glycoprotein of the rat underwent a 20-fold increase during 15 days
growth of the walker tumour and this increase was not affected when the rats
were treated with terramycin.  the protein increased at the same or a greater
rate when rats were subjected to ischaemic necrosis of one kidney or of two-
thirds of the liver.  boiled kidney tissue, on the other hand, had little
effect upon the protein response, and kidney hyperplasia had none.  it is
suggested that this protein increase is a response to substances liberated from
damaged or necrotic cells.

the natural history of autoimmune
disease in nzb mice
a comparison with the pattern of human
autoimmune manifestations
all mice of the nzb/bl strain spon-
taneously develop serological and
pathological evidence of autoimmune dis-
ease during adult life.  the nzb/bl strain
was developed by dr. marianne bielschow-
sky in dunedin, new zealand, by inbreed-
ing from an outbred colony of mixed coat
color.  several inbred strains--nzb, nzc,
nzo, nzw, nzy, and others, have been
evolved in dunedin from the original col-
ony.  evidence for autoimmune disease in
the nzb strain was first reported by
bielschowsky, helyer, and howie who
found evidence of an autoimmune hemo-
lytic anemia.  the dunedin group used the
presence of agglutinins for ficin-treated red
cells as the index of the disease.

the remaining kidney in irradiated
survivors of wilms's tumor
the intravenous urograms of 10 patients

had been removed by nephrectomy.
the remaining kidneys had been sub-
jected to varying doses of ionizing radia-
tion at the time the area of the diseased
kidney was irradiated.  in none was there
evidence of atrophy.  all were within the
range of expected normal size and most of
them were enlarged.

cellular proliferation and deoxyribonucleic acid
synthesis in compensating kidneys of mice
and the effect of food and water
restriction
compensatory enlargement of the kid-
ney occurred after unilateral nephrectomy
in mice.  fourteen days after the removal of
one kidney the surviving renal tissue                                  6
weighed 23 per cent more than single kid-
neys from sham-operated animals.  the
hyperplastic response of the cortex on the
second postoperative day was 8 times
greater than that seen in the same zone of
kidneys from sham-operated animals.  by
10 days after surgery the mitotic index of
the cortex returned to control values.  the
outer medulla also underwent hyperplasia
but only on the second day following
unilateral nephrectomy was the increase
significant.  an increase in mitotic activity
was found in the inner medulla of surviving
kidneys, but it was not statistically signifi-
cant.
both starvation for 48 hours and water
restriction for 60 hours prevented the hyper-
plastic responses in the remaining kidneys
2 days after unilateral nephrectomy.  when
water was given 48 hours after unilateral
nephrectomy (after 60 hours of water
restriction) significant increases in mitotic
activity were noted in the cortex of remain-
ing kidneys on the fourth and fifth post-
operative days.  however, even after free
access to food was allowed (after 48 hours
without food) no significant increase in
mitotic frequency of the remaining kidney
was found.
deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis in con-
trol kidneys of mice was highest in the cor-
tex and lowest in the inner medulla as
revealed by radioautographic studies fol-
lowing the injection of tritiated thymidine.
two days following removal of one kidney
the labeling index of the cortex of remaining
kidneys increased 3-fold.  no statistically
significant increases of deoxyribonucleic
acid synthesis were noted in either the outer
or inner medullary regions of the remaining
kidneys.
.I 667

compensatory renal enlargement
hypertrophy versus hyperplasia
after unilateral nephrectomy in the mouse, the compensatory growth
of the remaining kidney is characterized by an increase in rna and
protein synthesis within the first hour.  dna synthesis remains un-
changed for about 18 hours and then rises to a maximum at 48 hours.  by
the end of the fifth day, when dna synthesis has passed its peak and is
in decline, cellular hyperplasia has accounted for only one-fourth of the
increase in kidney weight.  thus it is shown that cell hypertrophy is both
the primary and the predominant response in the early phase of compen-
satory renal enlargement.
.I 668
.W
cell proliferation
in experimental hydronephrosis
and compensatory renal hyperplasia
mitosis counts and autoradiographic counts of nuclei labeled with
tritiated thymidine were made in the renal cortex of male rats in which
the left ureter was ligated.  these were compared with corresponding
counts in the remaining kidney after left nephrectomy, and in sham-
operated controls 24, 48 and 72 hours after operation.  the cortex of
the kidney on the obstructed side showed a greater number of tritium-
labeled nuclei and mitotic figures than in the kidney undergoing com-
pensatory hyperplasia.  epithelial and interstitial cells responded simul-
taneously on the obstructed side, whereas in the remaining kidney after
nephrectomy, the epithelial response preceded a slight interstitial re-
sponse by 48 hours.  the contralateral kidney in rats subjected to
ureteral ligation showed no response.
we concluded that the early response of increased dna synthesis
and cell division in the obstructed kidney was not mediated by humoral
factors; it was localized and probably had a different mechanism than
the proliferative response occurring in compensatory renal hyperplasia.

renal factors in the pathogenesis of hypertension
renal arteriography and other modern diagnostic procedures have provided
the means of establishing a close relationship between high blood pressure and
renovascular disease.  many of these cases are amenable to surgical cure.  at
the present time there is no single test for the definitive diagnosis of renal
hypertension.  careful and intensive studies are mandatory in the selection of
cases suitable for surgery, since hypertension has many etiologic factors and
involves many complex and sometimes obscure mechanisms.  aortography,
intravenous urography and split-function tests are among the most important
methods for definitive diagnosis and for the planning of appropriate surgical
procedures.
at operation, the most commonly observed cause of renal arterial con-
striction in the elderly is atherosclerosis, whereas in younger patients it is
hyperplasia of the intimal and muscular coats of the renal artery and its
branches.  renovascular surgery may require a variety of technical procedures.
in the successful cases there is a striking and permanent reduction in blood
pressure.
the accuracy of blood pressure readings is emphasized, since hypertension
is usually discovered for the first time during the course of a routine
physical examination.
.I 670
.W
cell proliferation in compensatory renal growth
rats with one kidney removed showed a progressive increase in weight of the
remaining kidney over a six-week period.
autoradiographic and radiochemical studies with 3h-thymidine indicated that the
increase in new kidney cell formation was maximal forty-eight to seventy-two
hours after unilateral nephrectomy.  this early response was chiefly due to the
production of new cells by the renal cortical tubules.  normal rates of tubule
cell turnover were achieved two weeks after operation.  the glomerular tufts
contained fewer new cells and their peak production was delayed to the
one-week period with a slow decline thereafter.
rats forty-eight hours after unilateral nephrectomy were chosen as a model to
study the effect of various substances on the magnitude of new cell formation.
the number of dna-synthesising cells in the stimulated kidney was reduced by
treatment with hydrocortisone, acth, 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene, and
1,2-benzanthracene; the numbers were increased by the administration of
deoxycorticosterone and aldosterone.

effects of adrenalectomy on
the parathyroids in nephrectomized rats
rat parathyroids were studied both after nephrectomy and after com-
bined nephrectomy and adrenalectomy.  as early as 24 hours after
nephrectomy there were morphological indications of increased para-
thyroid activity in the form of increased glandular volume and enlarged
cell nuclei.  the corresponding changes after combined nephrectomy and
adrenalectomy were less marked and the total serum calcium was higher
than after nephrectomy only.  these observations suggest that the adrenals
could induce a change in calcium homeostasis opposite to that of the
parathyroids.
.I 672
.W
pathogenesis of polycystic kidneys
microdissection confirms our previous de-
scription of an uncommon variety of poly-
cystic kidney found only in the newborn
periods.  it is characterized by symmetrical
enlargement caused by saccular or cylindri-
cal increase in size of all collecting tubules.
the number and relative length of different
generations of collecting tubules are normal.
nephrons are present in normal numbers,
and their attachment to collecting tubules is
normal.  the pattern of the nephrons is nor-
mal except for minimal localized areas of
dilatation.  interstitial connective tissue is
not increased.  intrahepatic bile ducts are in-
variably cystic.  siblings may be affected.
we believe that in such kidneys the be-
havior of the ampullae of the branches of the
ureteral bud is normal and that secondary
hyperplasia of the interstitial portions of the
branches is responsible for the greatly in-
creased renal size.

concurrence of hyperplasia and
neoplasia of the parathyroid glands
the concurrence of parathyroid hyperplasia
and neoplasia in a group of six patients is re-
ported.  two patients had long-standing renal
disease with azotemia and hyperphosphatemia.
in both hypercalcemia developed while they
were under observation and they were found to
have parathyroid adenomas as well as hyper-
plasia of the other glands.  a third patient
followed an apparently similar course.  one pa-
tient with primary hyperparathyroidism due to a
large mediastinal adenoma displayed hyper-
plasia of other glands in association with moder-
ate renal insufficiency.  two patients with pri-
mary generalized parathyroid hyperplasia were
found to have superimposed neoplastic lesions:
multiple adenomatous nodules in one, adenocar-
cinoma in the other.
these observations add new dimensions to the
diagnosis and therapy of parathyroid disorders.
they indicate the necessity of examining all four
parathyroid areas at time of surgery.  they also
emphasize that hypercalcemia developing in
patients with chronic renal disease is a manifesta-
tion of autonomous parathyroid function.

experimentelle nierenvergroberung nach unilateraler
nephrektomie bei ratten
untersuchungen mit 3h-thymidin
in this paper it is attempted to clarify certain questions as to the mechanism
of compensatory renal hypertrophy by means of histological, cytological, and
autoradiographical examinations in nephrectomy experiments on young and grown
rats.  based on the results of this investigation the process of compensatory
renal hypertrophy must be imagined as follows:
as early as two hours after unilateral nephrectomy, a distinct increase of the
mitosis index without a simultaneous increase in dna-synthesizing cells was
observed in the remaining kidney.  it is assumed that a cell division of
polyploid cells is involved, which were in a prolonged premitotic rest phase.
after a latent period of 48 hours, the dna-synthesizing cells and dividing
cells start to increase.  the maximum of the regenerative processes is reached
between the 3rd and 4th day after nephrectomy.  twenty days after unilateral
nephrectomy, the regenerative processes are largely concluded.
all tubule sections participate in the compensatory renal hypertrophy.
although the regenerative processes are most marked in the central section,
one cannot speak of the development of an actual indifference zone in the
regenerating kidney.
in young test animals, compensatory renal hypertrophy is determined more
by mitotic cell division, in older test animals more by polyploidization
processes.
the results of these investigations provide no certain indications for the
assumption that amitotic nuclear divisions play a major part in compensatory
renal hypertrophy.
proliferation processes which in extent and localization run parallel to the
regeneration of the parenchyma, are also observed in the cells of the
connective tissue of the renal vessels.

abscopal effects of whole-body
x-irradiation on compensatory hypertrophy
of the rat kidney.
the weight and dna content of normal growing (i.e., intact), and
hypertrophying (i.e., following uninephrectomy) rat kidneys were
obtained from several hundred sprague-dawley white rats.  the
effect of whole body x irradiation with 500 rad and local irradiation
to the kidney with 1000 rad, was then determined by following the
rate and degree of hypertrophy and the dna content of the kidney.
when calculated on the basis of body surface area, a constant ratio
of kidney weight and of kidney dna was found in the normal, non-
hypertrophying kidneys of 5-12 week old rats.  after 21 days of
hypertrophy these values increased approximately 50 per cent over
normal in rats 4-6 weeks old at the time of nephrectomy.  for
animals 6-14 weeks old at the time of nephrectomy the corresponding
increase was only about 20 per cent.
following uninephrectomy and x irradiation with 1000 rad to the
exteriorized remaining kidney, 4 week old rats whose bodies were
lead-shielded during irradiation showed no body weight growth
retardation, no significant difference in the dna content of the
kidney, and a small but significant decrease in weight increment
of the hypertrophying kidney after 21 days.
rats exposed to 500 rad of x rays with the kidney shielded during
irradiation, when compared with nonirradiated controls, showed body
weight growth retardation, a reduction in the dna content of the
kidney, and a reduction in the amount of kidney hypertrophy 21 days
following uninephrectomy.  a still greater inhibition of both kidney
compensatory hypertrophy and the increase in dna content of the
kidney occurred after 500 rad whole body irradiation.
food restriction in nonirradiated 4 week old rats resulting in
body weight growth retardation, elicited a marked reduction in
kidney weight and in dna content of the hypertrophying kidney 21
days after uninephrectomy.
it is concluded that the reduction in kidney hypertrophy following
whole body x irradiation with 500 rad is due in some measure to an
abscopal or indirect effect, secondary to decreased body weight.

radiation effects renal enlargement in the mouse
three hours following unilateral
nephrectomy weanling female cf-1 mice were
subjected to local abdominal or total body
exposure to either 500 or 600 r.  other
groups were given 1350 r to half the abdomen
with and without prior nephrectomy.  signifi-
cant decreases in renal weight gain compared
to controls were obtained in the 600 r total
body group and in the locally irradiated ani-
mals given 1350 r.  when the renal weight
changes are compared on the basis of the
ratio of renal weight to body weight in per
cent, an increase from .64% to .95% is seen
in animals subjected to nephrectomy alone.
the final value in all of the irradiated and
nephrectomized groups was similar, ranging
from .93% to 1.0%.  the results suggest that
irradiation in these dose ranges does not
exert a direct inhibitory effect on renal weight
increase but it limits body weight gain which
influences kidney weight.

renal hyperplasia and neoplasia
in rats given dimethylnitrosamine
multiple foci of hyperplasia and neoplasia were induced in the kidney
of rats that had been dosed orally with dimethylnitrosamine.  the younger rats
and the male sex had a greater incidence of renal tumors.  the hyperplastic
or neoplastic lesions were classified into two groups on the basis of their
histogenesis, namely that of tubular epithelial origin and that of interstitial
cell origin.  dimethylnitrosamine is recommended as a useful chemical
compound for the study of renal carcinogenesis.
.I 678
.W
the role of age and x-irradiation on kidney
function in the mouse
female mouse kidneys show a decline with respect to age in the ability to
concentrate the urine during a 24-hour water fast.  x-irradiation early in
life has no measurable long-term effect on this process.
kidney cortex slices of old female mice can concentrate p-aminohippuric
acid against a concentration gradient equally as well as slices from young
mice.  there is no loss in this ability by cortex slices from young or old
female x-irradiated mice.
it is uncertain whether compensatory renal hypertrophy after unilateral
nephrectomy declines with age in nonirradiated mice.  x-irradiation does
cause a reduction in the degree of compensatory renal hypertrophy in the aging
mouse.  this reduction may represent a loss in the ability of kidney cells to
undergo cell division.
the administration of testosterone propionate to old mice during compen-
satory renal hypertrophy results in an increased hypertrophy.  the increase is
relatively the same for irradiated and nonirradiated mice, indicating the lack
of a long-term effect of x-irradiation to reduce the ability of a target
organ to respond to a hormone.
the over-all conclusion of this study, with respect to "radiation-induced
aging," is that x-irradiation of the female swiss mouse early in life does not
have a pronounced effect on kidney function late in life but may have a long-
term effect on those processes concerned with cell division.

hyperaldosteronism, hyperplasia of the
juxtaglomerular complex, normal
blood pressure, and dwarfism:
report of a case
a patient with the syndrome of hyperal-
dosteronism, hyperplasia of the juxtaglo-
merular complex, dwarfism, and normal
blood pressure is reported in detail.  in this
patient, the aldosterone secretion rate in-
creased significantly and the serum potas-
sium rose slightly with sodium depriva-
tion.  with a low-sodium diet urinary sodi-
um fell to zero.  spironolactone with a low-
sodium diet raised serum potassium to nor-
mal.  infusion of albumin, however, resul-
ted in a rapid increase in serum potassium
and a fall in aldosterone secretion rate.  the
unique features in this patient are the re-
sponse to albumin and the lowering of uri-
nary sodium to zero in response to a low-
sodium intake.  in all other essentials, the
case resembles the two previously reported
cases.  treatment by subtotal adrenalecto-
my was not curative.

the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney and the
zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex in
the sodium losing and the hypertensive
forms of virilizing adrenal
hyperplasia
pathological and biochemical observations
are presented in two cases of virilizing ad-
renal hyperplasia: one of the sodium-losing
type and the other of the hypertensive type.
examination of the kidneys revealed hyper-
trophy of the juxtaglomerular cells in the
case exhibiting excessive sodium loss.  the
adrenal cortex showed hypertrophy of the
zona glomerulosa.  it is hypothesized that
the chronic state of sodium loss caused
changes in the intravascular compartment
which led to compensatory activity of the
juxtaglomerular cells with resultant stimula-
tion of the zona glomerulosa.
examination of the hypertensive case
(known to involve a different enzyme defi-
cit) showed hypertrophy of the zona glom-
erulosa without hypertrophy of the juxta-
glomerular cells.  the intrinsic overproduc-
tion of sodium-retaining steroids associated
with the genetic defect in this clinical form
could account for both the hypertension
and the absence of hypertrophy of the juxta-
glomerular apparatus.

studies on eperythrozoon infection in sheep
the intravenous inoculation of blood from sheep in the parasi-
taemic stage of eperythrozoon infection produced detectable
parasitaemia in recipient sheep within 7 days.  the parasitaemia
lasted from 3 to 12 weeks and was accompanied by anaemia and
occasionally by icterus.  no other symptoms developed and in a
controlled experiment on hoggs there was no significant difference
in weight gain between infected and control animals.
a concurrent attack of tick-borne fever led to the disappearance
of eperythrozoon from the circulating blood.  it is suggested that this
phenomenon may be caused by the pyrexia.
the incubation period following the inoculation of infected blood
in ten 3 to 4 week old lambs varied from 3 to 6 weeks.  in eight of
these animals the symptoms were less severe than in adult sheep, but
the two smallest lambs developed a profound anaemia and failed to
gain weight.
culture of the organism on sheep blood agar or on sheep kidney
monolayers was unsuccessful as was the attempted transmission of
the infection to mice.
the transference of keds and lice from infected to uninfected
sheep failed to transmit the infection, but a sheep was infected by the
intravenous inoculation of ground-up lice from an infected animal.
the only characteristic histopathological changes in infected
sheep were lymphoid hyperplasia of the malphigian corpuscles in the
spleen and deposition of haemosiderin in the cells of the proximal
convoluted tubules in the kidney cortex.

age differences in cellular
proliferation in rat kidneys
the hyperplastic response to unilateral ne-

medulla of the remaining kidneys of weanling

autoradiography.  tritiated-thymidine, which
is destined exclusively for nucleoprotein synthe-
sis, was administered to 11 control and 11 ex-
perimental rats 4 hours prior to sacrifice.
labeled tubular cells were rare in control
tissues, especially in medulla, where the per-
centages did not differ greatly for the two age
groups.  in the cortex of controls such cells were
three times more frequent for weanling rats
than for adults.  significant increases in per-
centages of labeled cells over control levels
were found in both regions of the remaining
kidneys for both age groups.  the percentage of
increase was greater in medulla than in cortex
and most pronounced in medulla of the young
adult rats.

phospholipids of the sexual segment of the kidney of the
indian house lizard, hemidactylus
flaviviridis ruppell
the indian house lizard, hemidactylus flaviviridis breeds seas-
onally.  in a sexually mature male lizard, from october to
may of the following year, the secondary and tertiary collecting
tubules of the kidney are hypertrophied forming the sexual seg-
ment.  the development of the sexual segment is synchronous with
the testicular cycle and maximum development occurs during the
period when the testes are spermatogenically active.  the sex-
ual segment is not developed in the females in any season of the
year; it is completely regressed in males during sexual quiescence
(june and july).  injection of 4.0 mg of testosterone propionate
over two weeks stimulated the regressed sexual segment to hyper-
trophy in males during quiescence and also in females.  the
apical portions of the cells of the sexual segment are loaded
with granular secretions which are stained with baker's acid hae-
matein and phosphomolybdic acid-stannous chloride, indicating the
presence of choline - containing phospholipids.  the composi-
tion of the phospholipids of the sexual segment, which is a unique
feature of the lizards and snakes, is unknown.  this preliminary
communication describes the isolation and quantitative estimation
of phospholipids present in the sexual segment of the indian house
lizard, hemidactylus flaviviridis ruppell.

tissue suspensions)
the stimulating effect on erythropoiesis of regenerated liver and hyper-
trophic kidney tissue after partial hepatectomy and unilateral nephrectomy
respectively was studied in the rat by means of the erythrocyte count, haemo-
globin determination, reticulocyte count and 59fe utilization.  the
reticulocyte count and 59fe utilization increased significantly after treatment
with normal liver and renal tissue and more strongly after regenerated liver
and hypertrophic kidney tissue.  the same effect was seen after treatment
with the sera of rats which had undergone partial hepatectomy or unilateral
nephrectomy.

hemihypertrophy and medullary sponge kidney
congenital hemihypertrophy is an over-
growth of one side of the body which is
associated with an asymmetry beyond the ex-
pected range.  it is to be distinguished from
hemiatrophy in which atrophy or withering of
one half of the body has occurred, usually be-
cause of neurological lesions.
this condition of hemihypertrophy, though
rare, is very frequently associated with other
congenital abnormalities.  these include several
in the urogenital tract, such as hypospadias,
cryptorchidism, unilateral renal hypertrophy
and an increased incidence of wilms' tumour.
.I 686
.W
chemical aspects of compensatory renal hypertrophy
the effect of unilateral nephrectomy on the size and composition of the
remaining kidney has been investigated in rats.  in normal rats the right
kidney is, on the average, significantly heavier than the left and has a
higher total content of dna and rna.  the 2 kidneys have almost identical
ratios of rna/dna and protein/dna.  after unilateral nephrectomy the surviving
kidney increases steadily in wet and dry weight for the 1st 4 days after the
operation.  this is accompanied by a much slower increase in total dna
content and by a dramatic increase in rna/dna ratio.
the rna/dna ratio in kidney is also affected by diet, being higher on a
high-protein than on a low-protein intake.  moreover, the rise in rna/dna
ratio that follows unilateral nephrectomy is greater in animals fed a
high-protein diet.  the changes in kidney weight and in total contents of dna,
rna, protein, and lipid phosphorus resulting from the feeding of a high-protein
diet were found to be of approximately the same magnitude as those in the
remaining kidney 4 days after unilateral nephrectomy.  the rna/dna and
protein/dna ratios are also greater in rats fed a diet containing 10% urea,
but the increase is much less than that in the remaining kidney after
unilateral nephrectomy.

the antidiuretic mechanism of hydrochlorothia-
zide in the treatment of diabetes insipidus
the changes in water and electro-
lyte balance during hydrochlorothiazide
therapy in 2 patients with vasopressin-
deficient diabetes insipidus were studi-
ed.  in 1 case, under fixed daily so-
dium intake, the urinary sodium excre-
tion markedly increased on the first day
of treatment, but the urinary volume
began to fall on the second day and per-
sisted low for 3 days after discontinua-
tion of the drug.  in the other case the
urinary volume markedly decreased
when the daily sodium intake was strict-
ly limited.  it further decreased on
hydrochlorothiazide therapy but after
sodium intake was restored it returned
to the pretreatment level despite con-
tinued use of the drug.
the antidiuretic action of hydro-
chlorothiazide in the treatment of dia-
betes insipidus is believed to be related
to the sodium depletion state of the body
brought about by increased output or
decreased intake of sodium.  sodium
and water reabsorption in the proximal
convoluted tubules in the kidney in-
creases and the amount of glomerular
filtrate reaching the distal convoluted
tubules decreases.  thus the final
urinary volume falls.

the action of oral diuretics
in diabetes insipidus
chronic administration of chlorothiazide and
other thiazide analogues in diabetes insipidus
results in a striking reduction in urinary volume
with increase in urinary osmolality.  this curious
antidiuretic action was first described by
crawford & kennedy (1959), and though it has
since been widely confirmed in both the pituitary
and nephrogenic forms of the disease, its precise
mechanism remains obscure.  a number of
investigators have sought to explain the phenom-
enon entirely on the basis of the renal actions of
these drugs (earley & orloff 1962, goodman &
carter 1962), whilst others have contended that
abatement of polyuria may be secondary to a
central effect of the thiazides in decreasing thirst
(robson & lambie 1962, skadhauge 1963).
over the past two years, we have conducted
detailed in-patient studies of the action of
various diuretic drugs of the thiazide and other
series in a group of 7 patients with pituitary
diabetes insipidus.

investigations into the thiazide-induced antidiuresis in
patients with diabetes insipidus
plasma sodium, osmolality and serum
chloride, together with creatinine clear-
ance, were studied before and during
thiazide treatment of 7 patients with
diabetes insipidus.
the diuresis was reduced by 28-39%.
the urine osmolality was increased by
7-128%.  an average decrease in plasma
sodium of 4 meq/i, in plasma osmolality
of 21 mosm/kg, and in serum chloride of
8 meq/i was observed.  only in one pa-
tient was the creatinine clearance re-
duced significantly.  the thirst-feeling was
reduced even from the first day of treat-
ment.  the diuresis was not minimal until
the third to fourth day.  if the diuresis was
corrected for the extra electrolyte ex-
cretion initiated by the thiazide, the
antidiuresis was found to be operating to
the full extent even on the first day of
treatment.
it is concluded that the antidiuresis is
mainly secondary to the natriuresis and to
a certain degree due to a decreased thirst-
feeling; but there seems also to be a direct
renal action, involving at least a reduc-
tion of the glomerular filtration rate.  a
pronounced antidiuresis was found by a
water deprivation test after thiazide
treatment in one patient.

salt and water
the antidiuretic effect of thiazides is thus the
result of the induced sodium deficit.  the fall in
serum osmolality may be contributory by
reducing thirst.  as depletion of body sodium will
be self-limiting the major hazard to the use of
thiazides is potassium depletion.  treatment of
patients with vasopressin insufficiency type of
diabetes insipidus with thiazides is only indicated
for those who are intolerant of hormone replace-
ment.  in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus thiazides
have a more important therapeutic application.

nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
chlorothiazide has been found of value in
establishing and maintaining adequate hydra-
tion in some patients; its exact mechanism of
action is not known.  the antidiuretic effects
of chlorothiazide and its analogues have been
studied in six patients with ndi, two of
whom were infants less than six months of
age.  dehydrated infants showed a dramatic
response to treatment.  with those unable to
achieve an optimal fluid intake prior to treat-
ment, the initial beneficial response was asso-
ciated with an increased fluid intake.  follow-
ing this initial antidiuretic response, a vari-
able degree of "escape" or resistance to the
action of the drug commonly occurred.  de-
spite the unpredictability of a prolonged anti-
diuretic response, a therapeutic trial of chloro-
thiazide in ndi seems warranted if diet alone
is not sufficient to maintain hydration.  it must
be remembered, however, that this drug is po-
tentially toxic.

fluid and electrolyte metabolism in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
the body fluid volumes have been fol-
lowed in two infants with nephrogenic
diabetes insipidus.  without treatment both
patients had a low extracellular fluid
volume (ecv) and a normal to low-
normal total body water (tbw).  following
thiazide therapy (case 1) and during a
fluid deprivation test (case 2) a further
reduction of ecv and tbw was found.
untreated both patients revealed a se-
vere hypernatriemia without any increase
in the urinary aldosterone excretion.
the first patient had a cerebral atro-
phy and a rightsided hydronephrosis, a
higher diuresis and a lower concentration
capacity was found on this side.  the
patient was treated continuously with
thiazide.  when an ordinary house diet
was given this drug could only maintain
normal electrolytemia in combination
with spirolactone.  a considerable increase
in height and psychic development took
place during this combined treatment.
it is noted, that nephrogenic diabetes
insipidus may be present in infants with
unexplained fever and vomiting in the
absence of polydipsia and polyuria.  the
urine may even be hypertonic.

diuretics in pediatric practice
clinical notes and comments
with the development of more and more
potent oral diuretics in recent years, these
drugs which were once looked upon as being
of only limited usefulness in pediatrics are
now receiving clinical application.  they per-
mit a new approach to the management of
edematous states.  that most of them can be
given orally is a significant advantage, par-
ticularly when coupled with their relative lack
of toxicity.  although the number of patients
in the pediatric age range who require these
agents is relatively small, they are valuable
adjuncts in the management of chronic renal
disease, refractory heart failure, and hyper-
tension.  this discussion reviews their pharma-
cology and clinical indications.

the role of aldosterone and vasopressin in the postural
changes in renal excretion in normal subjects
and patients with idiopathic edema
the effects of the upright posture
(leisurely walking for 2 hours) on half-
hourly urine volume, and excretion of
sodium and creatinine were studied in
13 normal subjects and 13 patients with
idiopathic edema, while they drank 150
or 300 ml. of 0.14 per cent sodium
chloride solution every half hour.  when
the 2 hours of walking were compared
with a preceding recumbent period of
4 hours, both groups were found to show
a significant antidiuresis upright.  the
administration of ethanol during the last
half hour of recumbency abolished the
fall in urine flow and in free water clear-
ance during the first hour of walking in
the normal subjects and significantly re-
duced this fall in the patients with
edema.  sodium excretion in the normal
subjects was slightly but not significantly
lower when upright than when recum-
bent, but in the edematous patients was
significantly lower when upright and fell
progressively over the 2 hour period.  ad-
ministration of spironolactone or d-
amphetamine increased sodium excretion
during recumbency in both groups but
increased sodium excretion upright only
in the edematous patients to equal that
of the normal subjects.  creatinine excre-
tion was not changed in either group by
posture or drug therapy.  similar studies
were performed on 5 patients with un-
treated diabetes insipidus and on 6 pa-
tients with adrenal insufficiency treated
with hydrocortisone alone.  lack of al-
dosterone (in adrenal insufficiency) did
not increase the amount of sodium ex-
creted above that of normal subjects in
recumbency and did not prevent the oc-
currence of significant sodium retention
in the upright posture.  however, lack
of adh (in diabetes insipidus) delayed
the antidiuresis upright for 30 minutes.
the results indicate that adh release
is probably responsible for the reduction
in urine volume during the first 30 min-
utes after assuming the upright posture,
but not thereafter.  the excessive magni-
tude of the orthostatic antidiuresis in
idiopathic edema probably results from
a cause other than adh release, since it
is not completely overcome by ethanol.
reduced na excretion during 2 hours in
the upright posture can occur in the
absence of circulating aldosterone, but
the abnormal magnitude of the na re-
tention in the patients with idiopathic
edema probably results from hyperal-
dosteronism.

the use and mode of action of ethacrynic acid
in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
the use of diuretic agents in the treatment
of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus had been re-
ported to result in decreased urine volume
and decreased clearance of free water.  a
study of the use of ethacrynic acid, a potent
saluretic agent, was instituted in patients
with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in an
attempt to achieve a significant antidiuretic
response while allowing a liberal sodium diet.
intravenous ethacrynic acid resulted in de-
creased urine volume, decreased clearance of
free water and decreased rpf and gfr.
prolonged oral administration of ethacrynic
acid promoted a significant antidiuretic re-
sponse when the daily sodium intake was
limited to 60 meq.  the effect of ethacrynic
acid on renal function, potassium and chlo-
ride excretion, and uric acid metabolism are
discussed.

the treatment of pituitary responsive
diabetes insipidus
in evaluating therapy in diabetes insipidus, it is important to note we
are altering only ten per cent of the reabsorption function of the kidney.
the kidney function in a case of diabetes insipidus is as efficient in its
activity as are biological tests.  the purpose of therapy is patient
convenience, economy, and normal function in society.  the diabetes insipidus
itself does not alter the life span, however, secondary factors may introduce
it into a health problem.
lysyl-8-vasopressin nasal spray is effective, offers a maximum of conve-
nience, and has produced no untoward reactions.
it is, as expected, ineffective in the treatment of extrapituitary (pituitary
unresponsive) diabetes insipidus.

antidiuretic effect of hydrochlorothiazide
in diabetes insipidus
and ch'iuan-lu
12 cases of diabetes insipidus
were studied during hydrochlorothia-
zide therapy under a fixed diet.  the
symptoms, blood pressure, urinary
volume, blood and urinary electrolytes,
plasma volume, electrocardiogram and
hypertonic saline intravenous drip test
were compared before and after treat-
ment.
a daily dose of 100-150 mg
brought down the urinary volume to
about 50% of the pretreatment value.
the initial antidiuretic effect was noted
8 hours after medication and the
maximal effect after the fourth or fifth
day.  owing to the kaluretic action of
the drug, 2-4 gm of potassium salt was
also given each day.  satisfactory re-
sults were obtained with dietary sodium
ion at not more than 200 meq daily, but
ingestion of excessive table salt fre-
quently diminished or even destroyed
the therapeutic effect.
the physical signs, blood pres-
sure and ecg were essentially un-
changed and the plasma volumes were
altered after treatment.  the hyper-
tonic saline test was improved in some
of the patients.
low salt syndrome was fre-
quently encountered as the therapy
continued over 1 month.  but this and
even secondary failure could be pre-
vented by timely use of intermittent or
alternative regimen.
the therapeutic mechanism,
indications and side effects of the drug
were briefly discussed.  the drug might
possibly act through the mechanism of
salt depletion, contraction of extracel-
lular fluid volume and decrease of renal
glomerular filtrate, and in consequence
urinary volume decreases and thirst is
alleviated.
.I 698
.W
the effect of hydrochlorothiazide on water intake
and plasma osmolality in diabetes insipidus in
the rat
a fall in plasma osmolality accompanied the reduction of urine volume in
rats with hypothalamic diabetes insipidus, given hydrochlorothiazide and an
otherwise normal diet.  the plasma concentration was not reduced with a
high sodium intake, although urine volume still fell.  normal rats and hypo-
thalamic obese rats increased their water turnover after hydrochlorothiazide,
yet their plasma concentration fell.  moreover the antidiuretic response to
vasopressin, which is purely renal, was also accompanied by plasma dilution;
although it is self-evident that rats which drink less are less thirsty, the
reduction in thirst after hydrochlorothiazide may not be a direct result of the
change in plasma osmolality.
as previously shown in patients (kennedy and hill, 1963) a high sodium
intake increased free water clearance in diabetes insipidus but did not
interfere with the reduction of polyuria by hydrochlorothiazide, whereas a high
potassium intake reduced free water clearance and prevented any effect of the
drug on urine volume.
.I 699
.W
antidiuretic properties of chlorothiazide
in diabetes insipidus dogs
chlorothiazide was found to decrease
urine volume and increase urine con-
centration in diabetes insipidus dogs.
there was no change in gfr, rpf,
tmpah, plasma volume, extracellular
fluid or total body water.  the one con-
sistent altered function was a decrease
in "free water" clearance.  diazoxide and
mercuhydrin were not antidiuretic.  it is
believed that the antidiuretic action is
dependent on the chlorothiazide-induced
saluresis.  although the mechanism of
this antidiuresis has not been clearly de-
fined, it seems best explained by postu-
lating a decrease in filtrate reaching the
distal nephron (giving a decreased final
urine volume) coupled with inhibition of
solute reabsorption in the distal tubule
(preventing the selective reabsorption of
solute in the distal tubule that is nor-
mally seen, accounting for the increase
in urine concentration).  the possible
role of the mineralocorticoids in the
antidiuretic response to chlorothiazide
therapy was investigated in diabetes in-
sipidus and adrenalectomized dogs.  ad-
ministration of sodium-retaining steroids
to diabetes insipidus dogs did not re-
produce the urinary changes associated
with chlorothiazide therapy.  in addition,
the antidiuretic response to chlorothia-
zide was not altered by adrenalectomy
or spironolactone administration.  there-
fore, the presence of the sodium-retain-
ing steroids are not essential for the anti-
diuretic response of chlorothiazide in
diabetes insipidus.

stable strontium in human bone: geographical and age
differences in the united kingdom and their
correlation with levels of strontium-90
a re-assessment has been made of published data of other workers on sr and
90sr in human bone.  in different parts of great britain the mean ratio of
stable sr to ca in adult human bones ranged
from 240 to 475ug/g.  extreme values
were found even as close as 40 miles apart (carlisle v. westmorland).
perinatal levels of stable sr were correlated with adult levels.  an estimate
of placental discrimination may be derived from the ratio, perinatal level:
adult level of about 0.7.
the concentration of stable sr in bones of children from 2 to 5 years old or
more was not demonstrably different from that of adults except in one area,
carlisle.  with the striking exception of london and south-east england the
change from perinatal to adult levels occurred in the 2nd year of life: there
was no particular change during the first 9 months or so.  in london and
south-east england the pattern of change with age was quite different: there
was a progressive rise in sr level from shortly after birth to the end of the
1st year by which time adult levels were reached.  it is concluded that
geographical differences need to be taken into account when making
physiological deductions about turnover of bone salt from changes with age in
the level of stable sr.
when children in the south-east of england and the rest of the united kingdom
were compared, there seemed to be a broad inverse correlation between levels of
stable sr and of 90sr.
detailed analysis of perinatal results from one area suggested that the level
of stable sr in bone was somewhat higher in summer than in winter and somewhat
higher in anatomically normal babies than in babies dying with gross congenital
defects.  90sr showed the seasonal change only.

fibrin and thrombosis in the central nervous system

only those aspects of disease of the central
nervous system related to thrombosis and the
deposition of fibrin will be discussed here; diseases
related to general vasculitis and aneurysm are

main categories: first, the presence of thrombosis in
small blood vessels or in the large superficial veins
draining the brain, and second, the deposition of
fibrin either in the ventricles or on the membranes
overlying the brain in association with thrombotic
lesions, haemorrhage, or infiltration.

the shunt was removed.  air studies demonstrating diminution of ventricular

ventriculo-venous shunts for infantile hydrocephalus
a review of 48 hydrocephalic patients
treated with atrioventricular shunts during a
5-year period has been presented.  we have
discussed function of the shunt, complica-
tions of the procedure, and revisions neces-
sitated by nonfunctioning.  the overall 75
per cent survival rate and 14.3 per cent in-
fection rate is comparable to that in other
series.  the major cause of death in our pa-
tients has been infection.
our experience to date supports the ob-
servation that spontaneous arrest of the hy-
drocephalic process does not occur once a
ventriculo-venous shunt has been estab-
lished.
meticulous introduction of a ventriculo-
venous shunt appears to be the present treat-
ment of choice for patients with severe hy-
drocephalus.  results are only satisfactory
when the patients are carefully followed
and complications recognized and treated
promptly.

congenital malformations of c.n.s.
it seems that only a small proportion of malformations of
the central nervous system can be explained in simple genetical
terms and that most are dependent, to some extent at least,
on environmental factors.  the nature of these has yet to be
determined.  dr. williamson found that the maternal aunts,
uncles, and cousins of her index cases of anencephalus and
spina bifida were more frequently affected than the paternal
relatives were.  she suggested that mothers of affected
children had some genetic factor which modifies the intra-
uterine environment and thus predisposes the embryo to these
malformations.  such a hypothesis opens up interesting
possibilities, but before accepting it one would have to be
satisfied that the higher incidence in maternal relatives is
not merely due to the fact that the history is obtained in
most cases from the mother.

experimental studies on cerebrospinal
fluid flow
a mixed suspension of kaolin and lyco-
podium was injected into the cisterna magna
of dogs.  blockade of csf space was produced
successfully in 63 of 75 dogs; in 48 of the 63,
ventricular dilatation of more than interme-
diate degree was observed.
in these hydrocephalic dogs experimental
shunting was performed either between the
lateral ventricle and the lumbar cistern or be-
tween the unilateral lateral ventricle and the
contralateral cerebral subarachnoid space.  uni-
directional, steady csf flow averaged 0.15 ml. per
hour in the cases of the former shunting,
and the flow averaged 0.25 ml. per hour in the
cases of the latter shunting.
csf flow rate from the ventricle toward the
cerebral subarachnoid space was larger when
intraventricular pressure was higher.  this in-
crease in flow rate parallel to increasing pres-
sure probably results from an increase in csf
absorption.  there seems to be an upper limit
of the flow rate as the pressure is raised.
transient reflux of csf flow was induced by
jugular or abdominal compression.
following intravenous administration of hy-
pertonic solutions, csf flow rate decreased
parallel to the fall of csf pressure and re-
gained the original value as the pressure was
recovered.  when the pressure fell as low as
50 mm. of water the flow almost stopped.

the dandy-walker syndrome
the dandy-walker syndrome is a specific
morbid entity in which the fourth ventricle
is grossly dilated and there is a congenital
malformation of the cerebellar vermis.  it is
nearly always associated with atresia of the
foramen of magendie, and in many cases with
atresia of the foramina of luschka also.  the
lateral and third ventricles are usually dilated.
figure 1 illustrates a specimen of the condition.
most cases present in infancy, but others are
discovered in childhood and in adult life.  the
oldest patient recorded to have had this anomaly
was aged 59 years.  the first recognized case
was published by dandy and blackfen in 1914,
but the best early description of the condition
is that of taggart and walker (1944), who
concluded that the cerebellar lesions were
consequent upon the atresia of the foramen of
magendie.  in 1954 benda proposed the term
"dandy-walker syndrome".

epidemics of malformations are to be detected promptly only if the incidence
of malformations in a defined population is studied continuously; and for some
epidemics the population studied must be very large indeed.

functional craniology: an aid in
interpreting roentgenograms
of the skull
analysis of the form of the skull is
facilitated by considering it to be composed
of a number of functional components.  for
the roentgenologist's purposes, division into
the facial or somatic skeleton and the neu-
ral skeleton is valuable, as is the recognition
of three functionally separate portions
within each calvarial bone: the inner table,
the diploe and the outer table.
the base of the skull is the only por-
tion that is preformed in cartilage.  this ac-
counts for the unusual appearance of the
skull in achondroplasia.  in addition, the
base apparently is more closely related to
facial and general somatic growth than to
neural growth.
calvarial bone forms directly from
membrane within the cerebral capsule.
consequently, the size and shape of the cal-
varia directly reflect the form of the grow-
ing neural mass.
the inner table of the calvaria at all
ages is intimately related to the dura mater
and directly reflects the form of the dura
mater.  consequently, the inner table re-
flects the form of the arachnoid mater and,
usually, of the brain as well.
the outer table of the calvaria serves
not only to protect the brain but also to
anchor many of the intrinsic and extrinsic
muscles of the skull.  its form, particularly
in thick-skulled mammals such as the pig,
is determined more by the demands of these
muscles and of the scalp than by the form
of the brain.
the principal function of the diploe
is to form a lightweight yet rigid separation
of the two osseous tables.  in addition, it
serves as a site of hematopoiesis; for this
reason it may tend to a specific volume at a
given age.
the calvarial sutures oppose separa-
tion of the bones of the calvaria while al-
lowing relative motion between them.
when the calvarial bones are passively car-
ried apart with the expanding cerebral cap-
sule by the growth of the neural mass, their
areas are increased by the deposition of
bone in the suture margins.  the sutures,
however, do not function as epiphyses and
have no innate growth potential: removal
of a suture does not disturb final skull form.
because the calvaria represents ossi-
fication of the cerebral capsule, it is small
when the neural mass is small.  the de-
formity of the skull and the secondary
changes that occur in the air sinuses and
the diploe can be explained in terms of
the functional cranial components.  the op-
posite changes occur when the neural mass
is abnormally large.
the correlation between skull size and
intelligence is only fair.  the presence of a
brain of distinctly abnormal size, however,
may be inferred from plain roentgeno-
grams of the skull.
premature closure of the cranial su-
tures may be due to an abnormal form of
the cranial base and possibly of the primi-
tive chondrocranium that precedes it.  the
abnormality is mediated through the dural
fiber tracts that underlie the major cal-
varial sutures.

hydrocephalus: changes in formation and absorption
of cerebrospinal fluid within the
cerebral ventricles
formation, flow and absorption of
cerebrospinal fluid were measured in normal
and progressively hydrocephalic dogs by
steady-state studies during ventricular per-
fusion.  the formation of cerebrospinal fluid
was found to be constant, independent of
hydrostatic pressure, and unaffected by the
development of hydrocephalus.  the normal
dog produced 0.016 ml. cerebrospinal fluid
/min. in the lateral ventricles, 0.011 ml. cere-
brospinal fluid/min. in the 4th ventricle and
0.20 ml. cerebrospinal fluid/min. in the sub-
arachnoid space.  the intraventricular forma-
tion of fluid was calculated to be 0.24 ml.
cerebrospinal fluid/min./gm. of choroid
plexus, and 0.3x10-3 ml. cerebrospinal fluid
/min./cm.2 of ependymal surface.
absorption of cerebrospinal fluid was
found to take place within the ventricles as
well as in the subarachnoid spaces.  the re-
sistance to absorption of cerebrospinal fluid
in the normal ventricle was much higher than
in the hydrocephalic ventricle.  the decrease
in resistance occurred as the ventricular
volume increased and the ependyma became
flattened so that in chronic hydrocephalus
the resistance was not significantly different
than in the normal dog.  the theory of re-
stricted diffusion was applied to the data to
calculate the diffusive permeabilities of crea-
tinine and urea, and from this the mean pore
radius within the ventricle.
using formation of cerebrospinal fluid
and data on absorption, the hydrocephalic
animals could not be distinguished from the
normal with sufficient accuracy to suggest
using this as a clinical test.  the reason for
this is that intraventricular pressure has
always been considered as if it were constant
when, in fact, it is changing constantly.  the
problem of ventricular enlargement concerns
the ability of the craniospinal contents to
adjust to and absorb the small but very rapid
changes in intracranial contents that occur
with each beat of the pulse.

dural sinus pressure
in normal and hydrocephalic dogs
simultaneous measurement of cerebro-
spinal fluid pressure (csfp) and venous
pressure in the anterior (ssvp) and poste-
rior sagittal sinus (tvp) has demonstrated
that in the normal dog the mean pressures are
related as follows: csfp>ssvp>tvp.
the statistical relationship between the pres-
sures has shown a poor correlation of ssvp
and tvp with changes in csfp.  on the
other hand, in the hydrocephalic dog, ssvp
rises to meet csfp and is related to fluid
pressure in a 1:1 fashion.  this could be ex-
pected to cause a "non venting" of acute
changes of csfp and a decrease in fluid ab-
sorption.  it is postulated that the mechanism
of ssvp elevation is a partial occlusion of
the sinus.

five-year comparative study of hydrocephalus in
children with and without operation (113 cases)
on the basis of a 5-year study of 113 hy-
drocephalic children of whom 65 were oper-
ated on early with ventriculo-atrial shunting
and 48 were not operated on, all of them hav-
ing been studied periodically in a similar
manner to determine mortality, morbidity,
intelligence, and related factors, the follow-
ing conclusions are justified:
the program in which shunting opera-
tions were done apparently gives significant
advantages to the children over the program
in which no shunting operations were done
(based on life-table data projected from birth
to 10 years)
survival: 61.8 per cent as compared to
22.2 per cent;
number of competent children (i.q. of
75 or better): 33.8 per cent vs. 5.5 per
cent;
number of noncompetitive children
(i.q. below 75): 27.6 per cent vs. 16.7
per cent.
the major cause of death and morbid-
ity in both groups is infection.
in the operative group, morbidity
associated with the shunting procedure is
related to obstruction of the shunt and
septicemia.  the early occlusions show a
correlation with abnormal, inflammatory
type of spinal fluid being shunted into the
blood stream.  the late obstructions are
associated with mechanical breakage of the
shunt or factors of growth causing retraction
of the cardiac end from the atrium.  prompt
re-establishment of a functioning shunt has
been possible in all instances.  periodic follow-
up examinations, irrespective of symptoms,
have proved invaluable in early recognition
of malfunctioning shunts.  septicemia usually
required removal of the shunt.
from the program of periodic evalua-
tions, including "bubble" ventriculograms,
studies of clearance of risa, and psycho-
logical testings, correlations showed:
intellectual ability seemed associated
with width of cerebral mantle;
width of cerebral mantle in hydrocepha-
lus decreases with ventricular pressures
of 120 or over; it increases with pres-
sures less than this;
prolonged shunting of cerebrospinal
fluid can give dramatic increase in
width of cerebral mantle, apparently
irrespective of basic etiology of the
hydrocephalus;
intellectual capacity could not be cor-
related with the basic etiology of the
hydrocephalus, but did correlate in-
versely with duration of increased in-
tracranial pressure.
the many etiologies of hydrocephalus
require large numbers of patients in each
group for thorough evaluation.  factors
favoring such studies should be carried out in
medical centers where appropriate disciplines
can study in depth.  prevention should be the
ultimate goal.
in the operative group, only 1 patient
compensated his hydrocephalic process and
no single patient demonstrated "arrest" of or
recovery from the basic hydrocephalus-pro-
ducing process in spite of numerous attempts
to demonstrate this.  this might imply a
necessity for life-long shunting of cerebro-
spinal fluid in these cases.

hydrocephalus
any present day definition of
hydrocephalus is very loose.  the
authors would rather adopt the
concept that hydrocephalus is an
abnormal condition characterized
by excessive amount of cerebrospi-

ment of the head.
the most common cause of
hydrocephalus is arachnoiditis fol-
lowed by congenital anomalies.  a
neoplasm is a rare cause.
the ideal surgical procedure
is the placement of a ventriculo-
atrial shunt, using either pudenz
or halter valves.  where these
valves cannot be availed of the
choice is between a conservative
waiting with medical support and
ventricular tapping from the older
surgical shunting procedures, like,
ventriculo-peritoneal, choroidoplex-
ectomy, thecal-fimbia, subarach-
noid-ureteral, and others.

recognition and treatment of hydrocephalus following
spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage
eight adult patients with hydrocephalus
secondary to spontaneous subarachnoid hem-

congenital malformations.
clinical and community considerations
two of the most significant medical
events of the century, the epidemic of
post-rubella anomalies in australia
during 1940 and 1941 and the pan-
demic of thalidomide embryopathies
in europe and elsewhere during 1960
and 1961, have demonstrated clearly
the importance of monitoring programs
to record the occurrence of congenital
malformations at group (for example,
hospital) and community (especially
city) levels.  the principle of report-
ing malformations and utilizing the
data for service programs or, better
still, for prevention, is not new, but
the methodical use of vital statistics
in a scientifically constructed surveil-
lance system is new.  so also is the
joint endeavor on the part of clinicians,
public health workers and basic scien-
tists to reconstruct an epidemiology of
deformity on the basis of time, place,
person distributions of malformations.
a primary need has been for stand-
ardized methods of classifying and
reporting congenital malformations.

the family history of spina bifida cystica
the family histories of 722 infants who
were born with spina bifida cystica were
studied.
the index cases were referred for sur-
gical treatment and were not selected in any
way from the genetic point of view.
intensive inquiries were made to ob-
tain a complete family pedigree, including
a prospective follow-up of siblings born after
the index case.
of 1,256 siblings 85 or 6.8% had gross
malformation of the central nervous system:
spina bifida cystica in 54, anencephaly in 22,
and uncomplicated hydrocephalus in 9.
of 306 children born after the index
case 25 (8%) or 1 in 12 were affected.
there was a progressive increase in
multiple cases in the family with increasing
family size.  in sibships of five or more, mul-
tiple cases occurred in 24.1%.
in 118 families cases of gross malfor-
mation of the central nervous system were
known to have occurred among members of
the family other than siblings.  cases oc-
curred in three generations.
it is possible that spina bifida cystica
might be a recessively inherited condition.

pulmonary vascular changes complicating
ventriculovascular shunting for hydrocephalus
a patient is described in whom pulmonary hypertension and cor
pulmonale were noted 3 years after placement of a ventriculovascular
shunting apparatus for treatment of hypdrocephalus.  in addition,
the histologic sections of lung tissue obtained from 65 patients with hy-
drocephalus who died at various intervals following placement of a
ventriculovascular shunting apparatus were reviewed with regard to vas-
cular alterations.  a high incidence of "old" and "multiple" pulmonary
vascular lesions was found in this group compared to the incidence
in control subjects.  this difference can be attributed to the operative
procedure.  the lesions in postmortem material were not
widespread and did not suggest the diagnosis
of pulmonary hypertension on purely histologic grounds.

etiology of trypan blue induced antenatal
hydrocephalus in the albino rat
wistar strain albino rats were injected with 1 cm3 of a 1% solution
of trypan blue.  three types of dye were used: matheson, coleman and bell,
chroma-gesellschaft and a highly purified sample.  the dyes were injected on
days 6, 7, and 8 of gestation.  fetuses were excised from days 16 through 20,
fixed, decalcified where necessary, embedded in paraffin, serially sectioned
and stained.  newborn young were treated similarly.  chroma-gesellschaft
trypan blue was without reproductive or teratogenic effect at the above doses.
increasing the dose did not increase the teratogenicity but did yield a
decrease in litter size.  both matheson, coleman and bell trypan blue and the
purified sample were teratogenic.  the most frequent neural defect observed
was hydrocephalus.  serial sections of the newborn hydrocephalics showed an
occluded or extremely tenotic aqueduct of sylvius in 31 of 33 sectioned
animals.  the fetuses collected from days 18 through 20 also had occluded or
stenotic aqueducts if hydrocephalic.  aqueductal stenosis or occlusion was
present in 17-day-old fetuses, but hydrocephalus was not conclusively
demonstrated at this age.  sixteen-day-old fetuses did not have aqueductal
occlusion in any of those examined, but stenosis was evident.  it is concluded
that the defect predisposing to hydrocephalus in the young of trypan blue
treated rats of this strain is aqueductal stenosis or occlusion.

bilateral papilloma of the choroid plexus
a rare case of bilateral papilloma of the choroid plexus
in a five-and-a-half-year old hydrocephalic girl is pre-
sented.
the tumor encountered at autopsy was not suspected
during life, the existing hydrocephalus being attributed
to either cytomegalic inclusion disease or toxoplasmosis.
after post mortem examination, it was evident that
the hydrocephalus was due to two factors; hypersecretion
from the tumor itself, and obstruction at the level of the
sylvian aqueduct by a delicate, tense, translucent mem-
brane.
an interesting and uncommon additional feature of
this case was the presence, within the choroidal papillo-
ma, of well-formed haversian bone.
a plea is made for regularly considering papilloma of
the choroid plexus in the differential diagnosis of hydro-
cephalus in children, for here, early diagnosis and treat-
ment might conceivably result in total cure.

the diagnosis of hydrocephalus
the early diagnosis of hydrocephalus
is imperative if definitive steps for
its correction are to be effective.
transillumination is a fairly accurate
procedure that may offer the earliest
means of determining whether or not
the infant's head is enlarging.
however, serial head measurements
constitute the easiest and most
accurate method for early detection
of hydrocephalus.  charts of normal
head size of full-term and premature
infants are available to aid the
physician in evaluating any deviation
from normal.  once the condition has
been detected, it is up to the
neurosurgeon to determine the
treatment plan.  the operative procedure
most widely used for shunting the
excessive cerebrospinal fluid is
insertion of a spitz-holter valve.
early detection and improved treatment
methods will help prevent irreversible
intellectual damage likely to develop
if hydrocephalus continues unchecked.

infantile hydrocephalus and hematoma in the posterior fossa
we have presented a case of hydrocephalus in
an infant, the basic cause being intracranial
hemorrhage in the perinatal period.  surgical re-
moval of a hematoma in the posterior fossa did not
give permanent relief of the raised intracranial
pressure.  a lumbar air study at this stage dis-
closed information that the passage through the
intracerebral cerebrospinal-fluid pathways was
normalized whereas the extracerebral ones still
were occluded by arachnoiditis.  the condition
necessitated a ventriculo-atrial shunt.

gastrointestinal
ulceration and central
nervous system lesions
there is both a real and an apparent in-
crease in the incidence of severe gastroin-
testinal ulceration due to central nervous
lesions.  some of this increased incidence
reflects recently devised iatrogenic measures
including new drugs and surgical therapy.
in adults, cerebrovascular lesions are the
commonest single cause of acute peptic ul-
ceration found at autopsy.  in children, we
found 25 instances of upper gastrointestinal
ulceration due to central nervous system le-
sions in 1,750 autopsies.  two general ana-
tomical categories could be recognized: acute
ulceration and malacias.
a variety of causative central nervous sys-
tem lesions was responsible in these 25 cases,
the commonest being bacterial meningitis.
other causes were poliomyelitis, brain tu-
mor, hydrocephalus, etc.
theories of pathogenesis are presented.
more experience with both drug and surgical
therapy is needed.  the recent development
of local freezing techniques offers promise
for reduction of mortality.

mansonia crassipes as the natural vector of filarioids, plasmodium gallinaceum
and other plasmodia of fowls in ceylon
it would appear from these
observations that m.
crassipes is the natural vector of
p. gallinaceum of fowls
in ceylon and possibly of other
species of plasmodium of
fowls or of related avian hosts.
if one of the other
plasmodia from m. crassipes is
in fact p. lophurae
then this will be the first record
of p. lophurae from
this part of the world.  we are,
however, not certain
whether the fowl is the natural
vertebrate host of
p. lophurae in ceylon.
we have seen crithidial forms in
the midgut of engorged
wild-caught m. crassipes.  this
mosquito may, therefore,
prove to be the vector of the
trypanosome as well.  the
trypanosome differs from
trypanosoma gallinarum and
t. calmettei which have previously
been reported from

filariasis in portuguese timor, with observations on a new microfilaria
found in man
the results are described of an
investigation into filariasis in portuguese timor.
two types of microfilariae were
found in blood films: one was wuchereria bancrofti
and the other, referred to as the timor
microfilaria, is probably a new species.
blood surveys showed that w.
bancrofti and the timor microfilaria were widely
distributed in the territory but that infection
rates were usually low.
clinical lesions were few and mild;
elephantiasis was confined to oedema of the
lower limbs below the knee.
the timor microfilaria resembles
that of brugia malayi in general staining
reaction and appearance and in the possession
of two nuclei in the terminal thread, but
differs in over-all length, in cephalic-space ratio,
and in failure of the sheath to stain with
giemsa.  it is nocturnally periodic.  it was
rapidly removed from the peripheral blood
by treatment with diethylcarbamazine citrate
in daily doses of 9.3-13.3 mgm. per kgm. body
weight or 3.3-5.0 mgm. per kgm. body weight
for seven days.  only damaged fragments of
adult female worms were recovered.
the timor microfilaria was not
found in cats, dogs or monkeys.
the vectors of filariasis in timor
are still unknown.

esophageal connective tissue of the infected animals, are described

experimental onchocercal ocular lesions in the chimpanzee
this is the first attempt to produce
onchocercal eye lesions with microfilariae of
o. volvulus in the chimpanzee.
live microfilariae, once in the anterior
chamber of the eye, could penetrate the an-
gle of the anterior chamber, the iris, the
ciliary body, the choroid and the vitreous.
most of the microfilariae injected alive
into the anterior chamber of the eyes of the
chimpanzee died within a short time.  com-
parison, therefore, could not be made be-
tween the effects of live and dead micro-
filariae.
microfilariae debris was demonstrated
within giant cells for the first time.
subconjunctival and limbal infiltration
with incipient pannus, inflammation within
the trabecular meshwork of the angle of the
anterior chamber and extensive active iri-
docyclitis were demonstrated in histologic
sections, although the conditions were clini-
cally quiescent.
the posterior segment lesion of oncho-
cercal chorioretinal degeneration could not
be reproduced.
subcutaneous and intravenous injec-
tions of worm extracts, derived from human
onchocercomas, may have contributed to the
onset of active choroiditis.  this sensitization
alone, without the intraocular injection of
microfilariae, had no effects on the eye.
various aspects of the pathogenesis of
human onchocerciasis are discussed on the
basis of present experimentation.

the occurence of dirofilaria magnilarvatum price
and brugia sp. in philippine monkeys
of 356 macaca philippinensis examined, three were
found infected with dirofilaria magnilarvatum price, 1959.
one of these was infected also with a species of brugla.
both species showed a sub-periodic type of microfilarial
periodicity.  these observations suggest that philippine
macaques may serve as reservoirs for sub-periodic
b. malayi on palawan, where high rates of infection have
been found in people living in small villages in the
forests.  mansonia bonneae was found naturally infected
with third stage larvae of d. magnilarvatum.  it is sug-
gested that monkeys may serve as reservoirs for sub-
periodic b. malayi on the island of palawan, where high
rates of infection with this species have been observed
in people living in small villages in the forest.

the filarial parasites of the eastern gorilla in the congo
a survey for parasites has been undertaken in 20 mountain
gorillas (gorilla gorilla beringei) from the eastern congo kivu
province.
six full-grown (two males and four females),
three adolescents
(one male and two females), and eleven
young gorillas were
examined, some of them during several
consecutive months.  nine
autopsies were performed.
no protozoa were discovered in the blood.
plasmodium parasites
which are common in gorillas and chimpanzees
from west africa
were never found in the eastern congo primates,
including ten
other gorillas examined previously and some fifty chimpanzees.
severe diarrhoea with a balantidiasis picture developed in two
young gorillas.  autopsy revealed however an intensive infection
with oesophagostomum stephanostomum and resulting fatty degenera-
tion of the liver.  oligotrichida belonging to the genus troglodytella
were commonly found in the intestinal tract.  oesophagostomum
stephanostomum eggs were consistently present in the stools of
the gorillas and autoinfection caused the death of several young
gorillas 4 to 6 weeks after their capture.
many microfilariae were found in the blood and the skin.  pre-
liminary communications were published mentioning the existence
of four different microfilariae in the blood of gorillas and of three
others in the dermal layers of the skin.  after a detailed study seven
species have been identified and described:  dipetalonema leopoldi,
d. gorillae, d. vanhoofi, d. streptocercum, microfilaria binucleata,
loa loa gorillae n.subsp. and onchocerca volvulus.  three of the
worms described have so far been discovered only in gorilla gorilla,
namely dipetalonema leopoldi, d. gorillae and loa loa gorillae.  two
of them were previously known from the chimpanzee, namely
d. vanhoofi and microfilaria binucleata.  one species, d. strepto-
cercum, first discovered in man and later described from the chimpan-
zee, is now also known from gorilla gorilla.  onchocerca volvulus has
been found in only one of the 20 gorillas examined.  gorilla gorilla
beringei in eastern congo might become through close contact
with man and his filarial vectors an abnormal or accidental host of
d. streptocercum and onchocerca volvulus or else might be considered
as an original reservoir of these filarial parasites of man.

a pilot project for the control of filariasis
in thailand
in a village in kanjanadit district of surat-thani province, south thailand,
where a field station for filariasis studies had been established by the
bangkok school of tropical medicine, blood films were examined from 977 persons
(95.5 per cent. of the total population of 1,023).  two thick films (each of
20 c.mm.) were prepared from each person and stained with giemsa.  it was found
that 21.1 per cent. of the people harboured microfilariae (all brugia malayi).
elephantiasis was found in 5.3 per cent. of the population.
microfilarial periodicity was studied in 25 persons; in every case it was
found to be markedly nocturnal.
the blood of 98 cats, 52 dogs and two monkeys was also examined.  no b. malayi
larvae were recovered.
mosquitoes were caught and identified.  in an initial survey, 4,557 mosquitoes
were examined, of which 568 were mansonia spp.  in 4,136 dissections, b. malayi
larvae in stage ii were found in one m. uniformis and in stage iii in another;
the infection rate for m. uniformis was 0.6 per cent.
spraying with ddt was carried out in all the houses during the last phase of
the investigation.  it resulted in a slight decline in the numbers and
percentage of mansonia mosquitoes caught.
diethylcarbamazine was administered to as many of the villagers as possible,
in a dose of 5 mgm. of the citrate salt per kgm. body weight once weekly for
six weeks.  eight hundred and eighty-eight persons received the drug (86.8
per cent. of the population).  considerable side-effects were observed in
nearly all microfilaria-carriers.  blood examinations were repeated one month
and again one year after cessation of the drug.  it was found that the
proportion of microfilaria-carriers had decreased from 21.1 per cent. to 2.2
and 2.2 per cent. respectively, the filariasis infection rate from 26.1 per
cent. to 8.6 and 8.5 per cent., and the mean microfilarial density of all films
from 4.8 per 20 c.mm. blood to 0.48 and 0.12.  larvae of b. malayi were not
found in mosquitoes dissected one month and one year after the mass therapy.

studies on loiasis in monkeys.
iv.--experimental hybridization of the human and
simian strains of loa
in the cameroons rain-forest there exist two strains of loa, each apparently
evolving in its own host-vector complex (duke and wijers, 1958).  the natural
simian parasite which is found most abundantly in the drill (mandrillus
leucophaeus), is characterized by the large somatic size of the adult worms
and microfilariae and by its nocturnal microfilariae periodicity.  it is
transmitted among the monkey population by the crepuscular canopy-dwelling
chrysops langi and c. centurionis.  the natural human parasite has diurnally
periodic microfilariae and is transmitted by the day-biting anthropophilic
c. silacea and c. dimidiata (bombe form).  it can also be transmitted
experimentally to the drill, in which host the parasites are of small somatic
size and maintain their diurnal periodicity.
as the two strains of contrasting periodicity can be maintained in drills, it
was decided to try cross-mating them to produce hybrids.  the present paper
describes the methods by which this was done, records the characteristics of
the hybrid parasites, and suggests that, when interbreeding, the two strains
segregate according to a simple mendelian pattern as regards periodicity and
somatic size.

thawed at 38 1c and
fed through an animal-derived bandrode membrane to laboratory-reared anopheles
quadrimaculatus.  the microfilariae were capable of developing to the third or
infective larval stage and migrating to the head and labium of the mosquito.

advances in filariasis
especially concerning periodicity of microfilariae
a review is given of some advances in our knowledge about filariasis during the
past ten years.
it is urged that investigations should be continued on methods to facilitate
the control of filariasis in large populations, by means of
diethylcarbamazine--e.g. incorporation of the compound in cooking salt, as
was done with chloroquine against malaria.  furthermore, steps should be taken
to protect young people against filariasis by systematic treatment in the
schools.
in order to understand the cyclical disappearance of microfilariae from the
peripheral blood and their accumulation in the lungs, the movements of
microfilariae in the pulmonary capillaries has been studied by cinematography.
apparently their accumulation in the lungs is not due to mechanical retention,
but perhaps they migrate round and round in the pre-capillary network of
arterioles.
the periodicity of microfilariae is best considered as a biological rhythm.
apparently the microfilariae have a circadian rhythm of their own which is
entrained and synchronized by stimuli from the circadian rhythm of the host.
judging by experiments with monkeys containing microfilariae of edesonfilaria
malayensis, the most effective of these stimuli from the host seems to be the
rhythmic variation of body temperature which occurs every 24 hours.

attempts to transmit wuchereria bancrofti to cats and to a toque monkey

the periodicity of microfilariae.
x. the relation between the circadian temperature cycle
of monkeys and the microfilarial cycle.
monkeys were used whose blood contained the microfilariae of edesonfilaria
malayensis, which has a nocturnal periodicity.
artificial lowering of the body temperature during the daytime caused the
microfilaria count in the blood to rise; and artificial raising of the body
temperature during the night caused it to fall almost to zero, i.e. inversion
of the normal circadian temperature rhythm of the body was followed by
inversion of the microfilarial rhythm.
the hypothesis is put forward that the circadian rhythm of the microfilariae
of e. malayensis (but probably not of the microfilariae of some other species)
is entrained by the circadian rhythm of body temperature, which thus provides
the "effective stimuli" to which these microfilariae respond.

circadian rhythm were transfused into a host at another phase of the circadian
rhythm, in an attempt to analyse the relative importance of the rhythms
inherent in the microfilariae and of those in the host for the production of
the well known periodic migrations.  the experiments were performed with
edesonfilaria malayensis (yeh, 1960) present in a macaca monkey from thailand.

biliary tract morphology and prognosis
of biliary atresia
in 86 infants who did not have extrahepatic "hepatic" ducts, present
observation after use of artificial
bile ducts suggests that the presence of the
gallbladder may be of good prognostic significance in biliary atresia.
there are 11 long-term survivors (as of october 1965) up to 8 1/4 years of
age (100 months) after use of artificial bile ducts in 86 babies.  a
gallbladder was identified in 10 of the 11 infants.
other specific factors for this prolonged survival pattern in these infants
with biliary atresia have not yet been identified, although suggestive
correlations among minimal hepatic fibrosis, maximal bile ductule
proliferations and the presence of the gallbladder were noted.
it is suspected that if any opportunity for long-term survivals exists for
infants to overcome the tragic occurrence of biliary atresia that the
surgeon should avoid trauma to the hepatic pedicle.
we may be able to provide a "guarded" rather than a "pessimistic" prog-
nosis when the gallbladder is found in the babies with biliary atresia.

decompression by means of a hepatic

congenital atresia of

because congenital atresia of the extra-

the age of 2 1/2 years and, after three opera-
tions, he was in good health developing nor-
mally and free of jaundice.  since he is now
8 1/2 years of age, has had two more opera-
tions, is still free of jaundice, and is again
in good health, his further course since 1960

neuroaxonal dystrophy in congenital
biliary atresia
neuroaxonal dystrophy has been described in 8 patients with congenital
biliary atresia.  the characteristic changes include axonal dystrophy, a mild
loss of nerve cells and a variable degree of astrocytic reaction, mainly in the
gracile, cuneate and trigeminal nerve nuclei in the medulla, and rarely in
other parts of the central nervous system.
the neuroaxonal dystrophy in these patients is remarkably similar to that
in patients with prolonged mucoviscidosis and in experimental vitamin
e-deficient rats.
it is strongly suggested that the neuroaxonal dystrophy in these patients
with congenital biliary atresia is a manifestation of prolonged vitamin e
deficiency.
the neuroaxonal dystrophy in these patients is also similar to that seen
in aging and bears resemblance to the axonal change encountered in a group
of heredo-degenerative diseases, the various forms of "hallervorden-spatz
disease".  the pathological similarity between these diverse conditions
warrants further investigation as to the possible metabolic
relationship between them.

extrahepatic biliary atresia: comments on the
frequency of potentially operable cases
in a 10 year period, 35 infants with extrahepatic biliary atresia were
encountered.  twenty-eight babies, who were subjected to surgery and operative
liver biopsy, are discussed.  although an operable lesion was detected at
laparotomy in only one baby, 5 further potentially correctable lesions were
discovered in the 14 necropsies performed.  review of the literature revealed
that few authors have discussed necropsy findings and that confirmation of the
diagnosis by liver biopsy has been neglected in many cases, including some
of those claimed as surgical cures.  it is concluded that the frequency of
potentially operable forms of biliary atresia is not really known.

metabolism and excretion of c14-labeled bilirubin in children
with biliary atresia
and judson g. randolph
radioactive bilirubin was injected intravenously
into 3 children with biliary atresia.  the isotope
over a period of ten to fourteen days was recovered
principally in the urine.  sixty per cent of the label
in the urine was found to be in the form of bili-
rubin.  distribution of the radioisotope was observed
to be principally extravascular but not, as in other
forms of jaundice, in the same distribution as albumin.
daily turnover of bilirubin was several times greater
than the calculated normal daily production of bili-
rubin.  this was assumed to be due to increased
hemoglobin breakdown, confirmed by survival studies
of cr51-tagged red cells.  the serum half-life of intra-
venously administered radioactive bilirubin may have
useful prognostic value in children with biliary atresia.

central regulation of enzyme activity and synthesis

activity of non-specific hexokinase (hk) in soluble fraction and,
particularly, in mitochondria of embryonal liver is much higher than

approaching adulthood values postnatally (fig.1).  embryonal liver
lacks specific glucokinase (gk) (1,2), although during the second half
of embryonic development there occurs incretion of insulin, known
to induce gk synthesis in the liver of alloxan diabetic animals (3,4).

ribonuclease activity in hepatic nuclei during development
mammalian liver undergoes marked qualitative and quantitative changes
during the development from the embryonic to the adult stage.  many of these

which may be related to specialized subcellular activity.  the involvement
of ribonucleic acid in the transcription of the information from the genome
into the construction of a finished protein molecule has prompted a study of
biosynthesis of the rna during differentiation.  although considerable effort
in this regard has been expended in amphibian1-5 and avian6,7 systems, as well
as in the sea urchin8-11, a paucity of literature exists with mammalian liver.
accordingly, an investigation of the alterations in rna metabolism which
occur during the development of the rat embryonic liver has been undertaken.
this report concerns the fluctuations in nuclear ribonuclease during hepatic
development and some of the properties of the enzyme.

an electron microscopic study of developing gall
bladder epithelium in the rabbit
the gall bladder epithelium of the
adult rabbit consists of two types of cells.
the first and more common type shows features associated with absorption,
notably microvilli, limited pinocytosis, some lysosomes and an elaboration of
the lateral cell membrane and intercellular spaces.  the mitochondria are
concentrated in a subapical band.
the second and more infrequent type is a dark rod-shaped cell of unknown
function but which may be a dehydrated epithelial cell.
foetal epithelial cells lack the functional adult characteristics; the mito-
chondria are uniformly distributed.  in addition they display basal granules
and apical apocrine bullae.
epithelial cell damage and white cell infiltration occurs between 24 days
after birth or just after.
just before birth some epithelial cells are very large and pale with smooth
outlines, others are more dense and display vigorous pinocytosis.
adult characteristics are acquired at or immediately after birth and pino-
cytosis subsides.  it is believed that water resorption occurs before the
functional changes which allow continuous passage of water into the
circulation.

lesions of the liver in hereditary
metabolic diseases
whether the various cells of the liver, both parenchymal and stromal,
receive genetic misinformation in all hereditary diseases caused by gene
mutation is unknown, but the metabolic capabilities of these several cell
types are so diverse that it is not surprising that their involvement in
many such diseases can be demonstrated by clinical, pathological, or bio-
chemical methods.  repetitive abnormality of the liver has apparently not
been defined for any disease caused by quantitative (i.e., chromosomal)
gene anomaly, whether produced by nondisjunction, translocation, or
major deletion, perhaps because relatively few such diseases have been
described.  as a result, the genetically determined disorders of the liver
surveyed in this paper appear to be the result of conventional "single
gene" abnormalities, and to be transmitted in affected families by men-
delian mechanisms.

acid catabolic enzyme activity in relation
to accessory limb and cancer initiation in amphibia
cathepsin and acid phosphatase were determined in livers and kidneys
of adult rana pipiens and triturus viridescens.  organ-specific and species-
specific differences in distribution of these enzymes were found, as well as
considerable differences in the effect triton x-100 on the two enzymes.
a heterogeneous population of lysosomes in respect to enzyme content and
stability is deduced.
we have found positive correlations between catheptic activity of the
implant and host tissue dissociation, and between acid phosphatase and
inducibility, as features of the phenomenon of implant-induced accessory
limb formation in urodeles.  further, we have found a positive correlation
between catheptic activity and resistance to virus-induced renal adenocar-
cinoma development in rana pipiens.

neonatology
considerable progress has been made in the
knowledge of bilirubin metabolism since the char-
acterization of "direct" (conjugated) bilirubin as an
ester glucuronide.  the metabolic pathway involved
in this hepatic conjugation is now well established
and has been the subject of excellent reviews by
sherlock and billing.
sherlock's diagrammatic representations of biliru-
bin metabolism (fig. 1) and of the possible mecha-
nisms of jaundice (fig. 2) are reproduced here
because they furnish a clear picture to serve as a
reference point for the discussion to follow.
it is interesting to re-examine current concepts of
the etiology of physiologic jaundice with this dia-
gram in mind.  jaundice may occur for a number of
reasons, described below.

red cell glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency--a newly
recognized cause of neonatal jaundice and kernicterus in canada
seven male newborns of chinese, greek and
italian origin presented with severe hemo-
lytic jaundice due to red cell glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase (g-6-pd) defi-
ciency.  in five, the hemolysis was precipi-
tated by inhalation of mothball vapours in
the home.  kernicterus was evident upon
admission in six infants and was fatal in
four of these.
g-6-pd deficiency should be suspected as
a cause of jaundice in all full-term male
infants of these ethnic groups.  the diag-
nosis can be confirmed in any hospital by
the methemoglobin reduction test.  in areas
similar to toronto, canada, where these
high-risk ethnic groups prevail, the follow-
ing measures are recommended: (1) detec-
tion of g-6-pd deficient newborns by
screening cord bloods of all infants of these
ethnic groups: (2) protection of affected
infants from potentially hemolytic agents
such as naphthalene, certain vitamin k
preparations, and sulfonamides; and (3) ob-
servation of serum bilirubin levels to assess
the need for exchange transfusion for hyper-
bilirubinemia.

differentiation of explanted fragments of
early chick blastoderm
ii. culture on protein-deficient medium
enriched with rna
posterior fragments of head process
blastoderms were cultured in vitro for two
days on a protein-deficient medium sup-
plemented with various rna's, after which
they were grafted over the chorio-allantoic
membrane for eight to nine days.
pancreatic (adult) rna enhanced
the development of the entodermal epi-
thelium.
heart (adult) rna caused hyper-
plasia of the epidermis with, in some cases,
keratinized papillary projections.
brain (embryonic) rna produced a
papillomatous epidermis with giant epi-
dermal cysts that were keratinized and
fibrillar as in feather formation.
liver (embryonic) rna had no vis-
ible tissue modifications.
in the controls there was no keratini-
zation, nor papillary formation of the epi-
dermis.  the epidermal cysts were very
small, unkeratinized and devoid of fibrillar
organization.
the results are discussed in terms of
relationships of proteins from brain, mus-
cle and skin.

the inhibition of cell aggregation by a pure
serum protein
the aggregation of embryonic chick and quail limb bud, heart and liver cells
in a shaker system has been investigated in order to elucidate the mechanism of
cell adhesion.
a new method of assessing aggregation is described and evaluated; this
method involved measurements of aggregation kinetics.  it was found that the
measured kinetics agree closely with flocculation kinetics, which provides a
direct quantitative measurement of adhesiveness in terms of the
probability of an adhesion forming on contact between two cells.
using this technique it was confirmed that aggregation is inhibited at
1-2 c. in the presence of serum but not in its absence.  the kinetics of
aggregation in the presence of serum at 37 c., the lack of inhibition of
aggregation at 1-2 c. by serum which has been 'conditioned' by the presence of
cells, and the similar lack of inhibitory power of serum which has been
pre-treated with antiserum antibodies, all suggest that serum contains a
factor which inhibits aggregation until destroyed by cellular metabolism.

statistical data pulled off a study of 30 haemolytic neonatal icteri
not linked to a foeto-maternal incompatibility, and of 200 non haemo-
lytic neonatal icteri.  among this latter, the two most important groups
are the malformative icteri (69 cases) and the neonatal hepatitis

between these two groups clearly appear in the comparative statistical
analysis of the clinical, histological and evolutive data.

the immunological development of the human
fetus
the normal human fetus is said not to be engaged in the formation of immuno-
globulins; the immunoglobulins present in the serum of the fetus and the
newborn are considered to be of maternal origin.  in favor of this opinion is
the observation that directly after birth the serum of the newborn contains an
appreciable amount of igg, with gm groups identical with those of the mother
(68-70).  the level of the igg of the neonate decreases gradually during the
first 3 months (3,27,71), which is generally explained by the catabolism of
the maternal igg, whereas the formation by the newborn infant is still
inadequate to maintain the original level (16,27).  the best evidence for the
transplacental passage is the almost complete absence of igg in the serum of
newborn infants from mothers with agammaglobulinemia (3,27).
the transfer of the immunoglobulins appears to be a selective process
(13, 15).  while igg is readily transferred, there is little, if any,
transfer of iga and igm, as has been shown by ultracentrifugation and
immunoelectrophoretic studies of the serum (12, 16, 19, 20) and the analysis
of maternally-transferred antibodies (31-33).  with more sensitive techniques
such as the double diffusion test in agar or quantitative immunochemical
techniques, however, minute amounts of both igm and iga have been detected
in fetal blood as well as in cord blood from mature and immature neonates
(12, 19, 20, 23, 26).  since large molecules do not pass the placenta, this
may indicate that the trace amounts of igm originate in the fetus itself, but
transplacental passage has not been completely excluded.
the absence of immunoglobulin formation has been associated with the absence
of plasma cells in the lymphoid tissues and bone marrow of the normal human
fetus and the newborn.  it has been reported that these cells do not appear
until a few weeks after birth (2, 3, 14, 25, 34).  however, in pathological
conditions such as congenital syphilis and toxoplasmosis the human fetus has
been found to respond to the antigenic stimulus with intrauterine formation of
plasma cells after about the sixth month of gestation (24,25).

galactosemie congenitale
this observation of a case of congenital galactosemia with
a particular familial incidence gives the opportunity of a
brief review on the subject.
of a certain point of view we must consider that galac-
tosemia is much more frequent than we suppose, that there
are many severe cases with a reserved prognosis, that even
with very slight degree of galactosemia, the disease must
receive the most careful attention from the pediatrician.

postnatal changes in the portal circulation
during foetal development a large portion of the
oxygenated umbilical blood flows through the
umbilical recess directly into both main portal
branches.  accordingly, these are exposed to the
umbilical blood pressure and have a wide
by contrast, the trunk of the portal vein is narrow
and there is probably only a small blood flow through
it from the inactive digestive tract, though the
pressure in it is approximately the same as in the
umbilical vein or perhaps somewhat higher.
immediately after birth the liver is deprived of the
substantial umbilical blood flow.  the portal
venous pressure falls to about one-quarter of the
umbilical venous pressure at birth.  however the
pressure gradient between the portal veins and
inferior vena cava remains constant.

pattern of serum transaminase activity

born infant with congenital cytomegalic in-
clusion disease is described.  this enzymatic

impaired development of rat liver enzyme activities at
birth after irradiation in utero
development of activity of three liver enzymes at birth was studied in rats re-
ceiving 180 rads of x-rays on day 15 of gestation.  at 20 days of gestation,
activities of lactic and glycerophosphate dehydrogenases and
glucose-6-phosphatase were not altered.  the subsequent increases in enzyme
activities in the 3 days between 20 days of gestation and 1 day of age were
only 30 to 60% of those observed in controls.  this finding suggests that
irradiation in utero may alter later development of enzyme activity in the
perinatal period.

changes in localisations of golgi apparatus and iron salts were taking place.

mitochondria in the form of granules were revealed throughout the embryonic
period and in adults.  no essential alterations in the contents of dna,

risk of severe jaundice in
glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase
deficiency of the newborn
the incidence of g.-6-p.d. deficiency and neonatal
jaundice in all male infants born in one year in an area of
the island of lesbos was studied.
of 634 infants tested, 29 (4.6%) were found to be
g.-6-p.d. deficient.  hyperbilirubinaemia of 16 mg. per
100 ml. or over was observed in 34% of g.-6-p.d.-
deficient newborn males and in 9.1% of those with normal
enzyme activity--in more than half of them in the absence
of incompatibility or prematurity.
this is the first time that such a high incidence of
severe neonatal jaundice has been reported in both a
g.-6-p.d.-deficient and a g.-6-p.d.-normal group.  it is
postulated that in the population of lesbos a second
factor increases the incidence of neonatal jaundice,
especially when this factor is combined with g.-6-p.d.
deficiency.

linfangiografia no estudo da filariase linfatica
in the first part of the present paper a study is presented
of the lymphangiogram of the normal african; the author has
noticed that it is coincident with the one of the white indi-
vidual.
the second part includes the lymphangiographic examina-
tion and the observation of lymph circulation (via risa)
during the several stages of lymphatic filariasis.
even during the asymptomatic stage, lymphangiography
shows ganglial hypertrophy with a slight fibrosis and occa-
sional discreet alterations of the lymphatic trunks.
in the symptomatic stage, the lymphangiographic aspects
vary according to the disease's different stages and there is
not always a relationship between the duration period of the
symptoms and the changes observed.
in lymphangites, there are frequent alterations of the
lymphatic trunks, i.e., increase in caliber, extensive and seg-
mentary dilatations, numerical decrease with visualization of
anastomoses and higher permeability.  circulatory trouble evi-
dences itself not only by a decrease in the rate of the lymph
flow, but also by a very marked ganglial retention.
in adenites, in spite of the marked ganglial hypertrophy
due to intense sclerosis, there may be no considerable altera-
tions in the lymphatics, but risa already shows clear circula-
tion troubles leading to lymphatic stasis.
in adenolymphoceles, the obstruction at the primitive-iliac
level causes the lymph flow to deviate through the pre-sacral
anastomoses and reflux to the inguinal glands, thus causing
their dilatation and the formation of varicosities in the affe-
rent lymphatics.
in lymphedemas, our lymphangiographic results together
with risa's allow us to assume that the pathogeny is chiefly
influenced by three factors: lymphatic obstruction due to lym-
phangitis, insufficiency of the collateral ducts, and ganglial
sclerosis.

adjuvant chemotherapy in cancer of the

the completeness of reporting, the avail-

warn of adverse effects, and the accumulation
of 300 cases a year have demonstrated that this
cooperative study group can provide a rela-
tively quick assessment of a new approach to
treatment of cancer of the large bowel.  it is
hoped that a study begun in january, 1962, on
the use of 5-fluorodeoxyuridine as an adjuvant
to adequate excisional surgery may demon-
strate that, with a drug known to produce
objective remissions in 20 per cent of a group
of unresectable cases of colon carcinoma
the five year survival rate in curative resections
may be improved.

cancer chemotherapy by prolonged arterial
infusion
our current experience is reported with
136 patients treated by prolonged arterial
infusion chemotherapy.  the patients pre-
sented a variety of far advanced cancers un-
suitable for conventional surgical or roent-

methotrexate or a fluorinated pyrimidine,
was injected continuously through a small
plastic catheter into the unobstructed artery
to provide a high regional drug concentration
for days to weeks.  the patients have received
drug infusion for up to 45 days.  their course
has been followed for up to 37 months after
treatment.
methotrexate with antidote therapy by
systemic administration of citrovorum fac-
tor was used preferentially in most patients.
a fluorinated pyrimidine, most commonly,
5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine, was preferred for
hepatic artery infusion of liver metastases.

development of a dosage schedule for adjuvant cancer chemotherapy

to reduce the risk of blood-borne

as a palliative measure for non-ra-
dically operated and inoperable pa-

for these purposes 3 dosage levels
were fixed:
a maximum tolerated dose for ad-
juvant therapy.
a maximum tolerated dose for pa-
renteral palliative therapy.
a maximum tolerated dose for oral
palliative therapy.

surgical palliation for lung cancer

this is not a comparative study and no in-
ferences or conclusions are justified regarding
the choice of this form of therapy as palliation
in preference to other forms of palliative ther-
apy; however we do believe that the terminal
course of the patient with lung cancer is bene-
ficially effected by removal of the primary
tumor whenever this is technically feasible.

management of advanced endometrial

a basis for progestin therapy for patients

is presented.  the criteria for selection of
patients for hormone therapy and the sched-
ule of administration of medroxyprogester-
one (provera) is discussed.  evaluation of
patients for objective changes only, i.e., by
visual, palpable, histologic, or roentgeno-
logic means, revealed complete or partial
remission with significant palliation in 8 of
20 patients (40 per cent).  response to me-
droxyprogesterone therapy is apparently re-
lated to degree of differentiation of the pri-
mary neoplasm, the well-differentiated le-
sions being more responsive.  documentation
of tumor effect by serial biopsies during
treatment provides an index to the histologic
changes this progestin produces in suscep-
tible cases.  the effects of therapy upon
serial urinary hormone excretion rates is
documented in several patients.
on the basis of our experience, the treat-
ment of patients with advanced endometrial
adenocarcinoma with the potent progestin
medroxyprogesterone seems justified.

chemotherapy of breast cancer
the majority of cancer patients who are
referred for chemotherapy are in far advanced
stages of the disease.  the difficulty in deliver-
ing an effective dose of an oncolytic agent
to the involved areas may limit the results of
treatment unless the patient's tumor is an un-
usually responsive one.  the variability in re-
sponse between apparently similar cases of
cancer of the same cell type has become in-
creasingly evident, and is as puzzling as the
fact that 20 per cent of patients with breast
cancer will live 5 years with no treatment.  the
decisions as to the choice between chemother-
apy and hormone therapy, as well as to the
choice of the chemotherapeutic agent to be
employed, may be difficult.
as experience increases, the usefulness of
chemotherapy in the treatment of cancer is
becoming increasingly apparent.  it also has be-
come apparent that chemotherapy cannot be
regarded as a curative procedure in advanced
cancer even though an occasional patient ap-
pears to have been cured.  however, the value
of the oncolytic agents in prolonging useful
survival time, ameliorating many of the dis-
tressing symptoms associated with cancer, and
providing the physician with an extra tool for
a positive program in the care of the cancer
patient is now established.

clinical experience with palliation
of metastatic adenocarcinoma with
5-fluorouracil chemotherapy
chemotherapy of solid tumors is becoming a
more and more helpful therapeutic tool.  it
is probable that within a few years chemother-
apy will become firmly established as an ad-
junct to the primary treatment of solid tumors.
perhaps someday a cancerocidal chemical will
be devised that can actually act as antibiotics
do on bacteria.  for this reason it is important
for all surgeons interested in the treatment of
cancer to try to keep abreast of the recent ad-
vances in the field of chemotherapy.  surgeons
should also begin to use some of the technics for
palliation of incurable patients so that when
these drugs are added to the armamentarium of
primary treatment of cancer, they will be
familiar with the various technics and the mode
of actions of the drugs.
5-fluorouracil (5-fu) has had extensive clin-
ical use and has produced significant palliation
in breast and colon cancers with about a third
of these patients receiving palliation for five to
six months.

ment, x-ray treatment, and surgical resection

poor.  only one patient in all three groups sur-
vived longer than two years.  it was our con-
clusion, supported by the opinion of others,
that x-ray therapy gave the best palliation in
most cases and that surgical resection for cure

carcinoma of bladder: cobalt therapy
from 1959 to 1962, 202 patients have received
radiotherapy for carcinoma of the bladder.  radi-
cal therapy with cobalt-60 has been done in 121
of these cases.  these patients received tumor
doses in excess of 5000 rad in 3 weeks.  of 49 pa-
tients followed for 2 years after radical treatment,
28 are alive.  sixteen out of 32 patients with
stage b2, c or d tumors are alive; while 15 pa-
tients survived out of 30 with tumors of grades
3 and 4 (broders').  four of the 28 survivors had
cystectomy performed and none showed residual
disease in the bladder or lymph nodes.  the com-
plications of radiotherapy presented were not
considered to be excessive.
we believe that radiotherapy should be the
initial treatment for patients with infiltrative
carcinoma of the bladder.  the survivals pre-
sented at 2 years are better than those quoted for
radical cystectomy (whitmore and marshall)
and useful bladder function is preserved for the
majority of survivors.  we reserve cystectomy for
specific indications.

polyposis of colon
as seen in
private practice
familial polyposis of the colon may
present itself in a variety of clinical en-
tities.  from the cases discussed in this
paper the following forms may be enu-
merated:
(1) an asymptomatic phase with dis-
crete polyposis.
(2) a mildly asymptomatic stage
with diffuse polyposis.
(3) a premalignant phase with car-
cinomas in situ.
(4) grossly malignant phase char-
acterized by anemia and carcinomatosis,
possibly of multicentric origin.
to secure a complete cure it is im-
perative that the clinician discover and
the surgeon treat the disease in its pre-
malignant state.
worthwhile palliative results may be
obtained by surgery in incurable cases
by extensive resection of the primary
lesions and subsequent resection of any
recurrences or metastasis, whether local
or distant by second and third looks is
necessary.
special emphasis should be paid to
the emotional problems of the patients.
an encouraging, sympathetic attitude on
the part of the surgeon is essential and
rewarding.

systemic chemotherapy
for cns metastases
of solid tumors
of the 13 cases studied, remissions were ob-
tained in eight.  this 62% remission rate is not
significant because of the number of variables
present.  however, we believe that chemother-
apy for this type of patient is indicated, as sup-
ported by the reported data.  the results suggest
that the blood supply to solid tumors is different
from that of tumors associated with hematopoi-
etic disorders.  the latter respond very poorly,
if at all, to systemic therapy.  although we were
not able to measure the central nervous system
(cns) lesions exactly, the regression of the
cns symptomatology was significant.  in pa-
tients who had other demonstrable metastatic
disease, those lesions also regressed.  with this
evidence we feel that patients with metastatic
cns lesions, even when these have recently
resulted in paralysis or seizures, should be con-
sidered for systemic chemotherapy.

combined 5-fluorouracil and supervoltage
radiation therapy in the palliative manage-

a pilot study
malcolm y. colby, margaret a. holbrook
5-fluorouracil in combination with supervoltage radiation
therapy was employed in the palliative treatment of 44 pa-
tients with advanced gastrointestinal carcinoma.
a total dose of from 40 to 50 mg. per kilogram of body
weight of 5-fluorouracil given by rapid intravenous injection
at the onset of radiation therapy was found to be relatively
safe and tolerable.  larger doses were associated with excessive
toxicity and mortality.
a sufficient number of patients achieved objective and
subjective palliation to justify controlled study of the possible
additive or synergistic role that 5-fluorouracil may have when
combined with radiation therapy.

palliation by radiotherapy
the purpose of radiotherapy in the management
of cancer of the lung is first to cure the disease;
second, to prolong useful and comfortable exist-
ence; and third, to provide comfort and relief of
suffering to those who are symptomatic and in-
curable.
cancers of the lung vary quite widely in their
response to radiation.  those of glandular origin,
the adenocarcinoma, are more often than not of
modest susceptibility and sometimes quite resis-
tant.  the very undifferentiated, the so-called oat-
cell cancers, are often of exquisite sensitivity, re-
sponding to irradiation almost like lymphomas.
most cancer of the lung, however, is squamous-cell
carcinoma and as such may be considered to be
moderately radiosensitive in much the same order
of magnitude as squamous-cell carcinoma of the
skin, cervix or larynx, and should, in theory, be
curable by this means in the same degree.  unfor-
tunately, this has to date not been found to be
true.  the reasons are principally two: first and
foremost, by the time a diagnosis is made, cancer
of the lung has more often than not, estimated at
80% and more, spread beyond the site of origin,
thus making cure by any effective means presently
available unlikely.  second, the substrate in which
the cancer grows, the lung, tolerates radiation less
well than do the tissues which surround the highly
radiocurable epithelial cancers such as carcinoma of
the skin, cervix, and larynx, thus making an un-
favorable therapeutic ratio.

chlorambucil-prednisolone therapy
for disseminated breast carcinoma
over a 7 1/2-year period, 71 patients with
disseminated breast cancer were treated
with combined alkylating-agent-cortico-
steroid therapy.  chlorambucil and pred-
nisolone were the drugs of choice.  these
agents, administered orally, produced no
serious or disagreeable toxic effects.  twen-
ty-four patients (33.8%) had objective
regression of six months' duration or long-
er; average survival time after therapy
was 23.9 months.  results are statistically
similar to those obtained with sex-steroid
and endocrine-ablation therapy, presum-
ably because the three modalities have a
similar mechanism of action, ie. suppres-
sion and/or eradication of endogenous
estrogen.

recent advances in the treatment of
cancer of the esophagus
whether combining surgery and supervoltage radiation therapy will
noticeably improve the 5-year survival rate for carcinoma of the esopha-
gus remains to be seen.  it is encouraging, however, to observe at the time
of operation that the previously irradiated esophagus is firmly encased in
fibrous tissue, which gives the impression that the danger of disseminating
tumor at the time of resection is diminished.  in addition, the fibrosis sug-
gests that the tumor that had spread locally, beyond the limits of surgical
excision, may have been destroyed.

cyclophosphamide in the management of
advanced bronchial carcinoma
forty patients suffering from advanced bronchial
carcinoma who were treated with cyclophospha-
mide are reviewed.  the selective effect of the drug
in tumours of the oat-cell type is noted.  it is
suggested that relapses which occur while the
patient is on oral maintenance therapy may be
controlled by a further intravenous course of
cyclophosphamide.

patients referred to in this paper are available on

esophageal obstruction
the use of an endoscopically inserted tube in the
care of esophageal carcinoma
our experience suggests that the en-
doscopic insertion of intraluminal tubes
provides a relatively simple and reason-
ably safe method of dealing with some
of the problems which arise in the man-
agement of patients with esophageal car-
cinoma.  such tubes would appear to be
of particular use in handling the prob-
lems of obstruction and regurgitation in
patients with incurable tumors, but may
also be helpful in preparing severely
debilitated patients with esophageal car-
cinoma to withstand the rigors of opera-
tion and radiation therapy.

palliative radiation therapy
the care of the patient with "incurable" cancer may be
directed by physicians of various backgrounds and per-
suasions.  if this physician has little experience in such
care, he is prone to be influenced by still prevalent atti-
tudes of therapeutic futility or by equally unjustified
premature claims for widely publicized methods recent on
the scene.  surgery and radiation therapy remain the
dominant treatment forces for the patient with cancer.  it
is unfortunate that lack of demonstration of good radiation
therapy has led to unjustified condemnation of the method
rather than the user, with resultant loss to the patient's
welfare.  to obtain maximal benefit, radiation therapy
must be allowed indications and contraindications like any
therapeutic modality.  these must be the responsibility of
the therapeutic radiologist.  application of realistically
stringent indications and contraindications does not lessen
useful accomplishment, but avoids unnecessary morbidity,
waste of time, money and effort, and delay in seeking
suitable treatment.

between those cases who had a preliminary
mastoidectomy and those who did not.  the use of
megavoltage x-rays probably increases the survival
rate.

sustained palliation in
ovarian carcinoma
management of 64 cases of advanced
ovarian carcinoma has been analyzed.
an attempt is made to compare the
value of radiation and the value of chloram-
bucil, using salvage time and sustained pal-
liation as end points.
chlorambucil, an outpatient oral medi-
cation, appears to be as efficacious as ra-
diation in advanced ovarian carcinoma.
chlorambucil may be used before or
after irradiation therapy.
pleural and peritoneal effusion respond
favorably to chlorambucil 80% of the time.
the possibility of using a different
dosage schedule is discussed.

clues in dealing with
cancer patients
it is clear that the patient with cancer changed
his pattern of communication at different stages of
the disease.  these patterns in communication were
the basis or clues for the doctor and paramedical
personnel to consider in making total care more
effective.  the bedside clinician of past days knew
these clues instinctively in his wise ministrations.
thanks to a gifted social worker these have been
now made manifest to help all of us in dealing
with cancer and perhaps other chronic relentless
diseases.

ing that there was always hope that something new in the
way of treatment would turn up, and life would then be

advanced cancer of the breast
treated primarily with irradiation
the five-year results in 109 patients
treated primarily with irradiation for
cancer of the breast, mostly in the late
stages, have been analyzed.
in all cases, the initial intent was to
control with x radiation alone the primary
tumor involving the breast and its entire
lymphatic drainage.  irradiation remained
essentially the sole method of treatment in
84 cases.  postirradiation mastectomy was
performed in the 25 other patients, who
initially had been considered inoperable.
the plan of treatment has consisted of a
single continuous course of radiation ther-
apy, protracted over a period of seventy-
five to one hundred days and administered
in 3 closely integrated phases.  tissue
doses, superficial and deep, must be
brought to the highest levels required for
maximum biological effects within the
tolerance of the structures involved.
the immediate effects of irradiation
alone have been remarkable.  the re-
gression of neoplastic manifestations in the
breast and palpable nodes, the degree of
healing of ulcerated carcinoma, and the
incidence of recurrence have been re-
corded and assessed to determine the
efficacy of treatment.

the management of disseminated
cancer of the breast
when mammary cancer has spread to tissues beyond

and tumor growth retarded by skillful and sympathetic
application of irradiation, surgical ablation, hormone ad-
ministration, and chemotherapy.  given in conjunction
with analgesics, sedatives, and ataractic drugs, these
measures can frequently reduce disability and pain and
prolong the period of useful comfortable life.

toilet training of an autistic eight-year-old through
conditioning therapy: a case report
operant conditioning techniques have been successfully
used in the treatment of a wide variety of be-
havioral problems including hysterical blindness (brady
and lind, 1961), tics (barrett, 1962), psychotic
symptoms (lindsley, 1956; 1960, 1961), reading disabilities
(rachman, 1962) stuttering (flanagan et. al.,
1958) enuresis (mowrer and mowrer, 1938; lovibond,
1961, 1963a, b) and encopresis (neale, 1963;
madsen, 1965).  neale (1963) successfully treated three
out of four encopretic children using operant
training techniques.  in the case of one 9-yr-old boy, with
an 18 month history of encopresis, going to the
toilet was rewarded by a candy, praise and recording the
event in a special book in the boy's presence.
soiling was not inadvertently rewarded (e.g. attention) or
punished; the boy would be given a clean pair
of pants without comment.  neale reports that response to
treatment was rapid and complete and 6 months
after toilet training there had been no relapse in bowel habits.
procedures similar to those used by neale were used in
the case reported here.  positive and, in a
small number of instances, negative reinforcement were used
to toilet train an 8-yr-old boy diagnosed by
a child psychiatrist/neurologist as having infantile autism.

incidence of symptoms of early infantile autism in
subsequently hospitalized psychiatric patients
this study was concerned with the
relationship between the occurrence dur-
ing the first two years of life of symptoms
of early infantile autism, as retrospective-
ly reported by the mothers of s's and
subsequent adjustment.  the mothers of
69 unmarried young hospitalized psychia-
tric patients were interviewed to deter-
mine the presence or absence of each of
28 different signs contained in a check
list.  the signs represent characteristic
features that are reportedly often found
in conjunction with early infantile autism.
as a control, 50 mothers of high school
students residing in the community and
presenting no significant adjustment prob-
lems were questioned in regard to the
very same items.
the results indicated that there were
significantly more symptoms reported for
patients than for normals, and that this
finding applied to the overall number of
symptoms as well as to several subcate-
gories of symptoms.  the items classified
under the heading of "social withdrawal"
appeared to be the most sensitive in dif-
ferentiating the groups.  it was also found
that 11 of the 28 signs distinguished be-
tween the patients and normals, with all
except one occurring more frequently in
the former group.  it was concluded that
a significant relationship existed between
the reported presence of symptoms that
are often associated with severe and early
ego impairment and subsequent status as
a mental hospital patient.  this study does
not provide any direct answer to the ques-
tion of what proportion of children with
infantile autism are later able to make an
adequate adjustment outside of a mental
hospital.

eeg abnormalities in early childhood schizophrenia:
a double-blind study of psychiatrically distrubed
and normal children during promazine sedation
eeg tracings during promazine sedation
were obtained on 58 children who had
autistic or symbiotic childhood psychosis.
for comparison eeg's were done under
identical conditions on 4 other groups of
children: 44 with chronic undifferentiated
schizophrenia; 37 non-psychotic children
with severe, acting-out behavior disorders;
10 with neuroses; and 13 psychiatrically
normal children.  final clinical diagnoses
were made without knowledge of the eeg
readings as determined for this study, and
the eeg's were all placed in random order
and read without any knowledge of the
clinical diagnosis.  eeg abnormalities ac-
cepted were focal slowing, focal spikes,
paroxysmal spikes and waves, and par-
oxysmal spikes and waves with independent
spikes.
among the 149 patients 51% had abnormal
records.  none of the psychiatrically normal
children had eeg abnormalities.  except
for the neurotics, the eeg abnormalities
were qualitatively and quantitatively sim-
ilar in the psychiatric patients.  the
most frequent abnormalities were ir-
regular paroxysmal spike and wave com-
plexes, often best seen during the
transition from wake to sleep.  of the 149
patients, 33% had this complex, either alone
or with independent spikes.  although these
complexes were most frequent in the au-
tistic-symbiotic group, the incidence was
not statistically significantly different from
the higher performing, chronic undiffer-
entiated schizophrenics who had communi-
cative speech or the non-psychotic children
with acting-out behavior disorders.
of the 58 autistic-symbiotic children, 19%
had seizures, which is similar to the 13%
seizure incidence in the remaining 91 psy-
chiatric patients.
whether the cerebral dysfunction im-
plied by this study is a primary disorder
or is secondary to some factor such as the
effect of prolonged anxiety on body chem-
istry cannot be decided at this time.  never-
theless, an organic concomitant has been
demonstrated in 51% of the psychiatrically
disturbed children.  by increasing the
amount of time included in the eeg sam-
ple, the incidence of electrical abnormalities
might be even higher.

on early infantile psychosis.
the symbiotic and autistic syndromes
in conclusion, i wish to state that the
core of child psychosis must
be sought in one or the other of the
described distortions of the sym-
biotic phase.  in the first case, what lay
at the heart of the psychotic dis-
turbance was the marked emotional
unavailability of the mother,
which alternated with a purely physical
extreme closeness during the
breast-feeding situations, and particularly
with the destructiveness of
the mother's unpredictable rage attacks.
the contrasting experiences
drove the child to the autistic warding
off of any human contact and
the de-animation of the world of reality.
constitutional factors could
not, in this case, be evaluated with any
degree of accuracy.
in the second case, it was, by contrast,
the mother's ever-presence
that created an unendurable instrusion
upon and interference with
the structuralization of the budding ego,
which constitutionally and
perhaps predispositionally may have been
very vulnerable.  this made
it impossible for the infant to experience
the normal alternation of
the gratification-frustration sequences at
his own pace; it also made
the process of individuation in the
separation-individuation period
one which was beset with abysmal panic.
in both instances, we can see that it was
primarily in the severe dis-
tortions of the normal symbiosis that the
child psychosis had its roots.

autopathy:follow-up of cases

to present 5 cases which appear to conform to

sensory dominance
in autistic imbecile children and controls
in a previous experiment (hermelin and
o'connor, 1964) it was found that autistic
and control imbecile children responded most
frequently to a light stimulus in conditions of
bimodal, simultaneous stimulation.  however,
the role of the relative intensity level of the
stimuli remained to be determined.  in the
present experiment a light and a sound, or a
light and a verbal command were presented
simultaneously in various intensity combina-
tions.  all responses, irrespective of the stim-
ulus to which they were made, were
rewarded.  autistic, mongol, and nonmongol
imbecile children were tested.  in addition to
a tendency for visual dominance results
showed that independent of modality, high
intensities affected all groups.  nonmongol
imbecile children also responded significantly
more frequently to the verbal than to the
sound stimulus, while the other two groups
did not.

dreaming sleep in autistic twins

was observed during one spontaneous all
night sleep session during which their

patterning and amount of dreaming sleep to
each other and to that reported for normal
children of the same age.

twins discordant
for early infantile autism
a pair of heterozygous twins discordant
for early infantile autism is reported and the
relevant literature reviewed.  although mani-
fest organic factors were ruled out, the twins'
physical development was different.  a spe-
cific emotional etiology was not demon-
strated.  the few available twin studies offer
findings consistent with the hypothesis that
genetic factors are relevant to the develop-
ment of childhood autism.  evidence is also
presented that impaired acquisition of lan-
guage may have hereditary determinants.
a second set of probably homozygous
twins are reported who were also discordant
for autism.  this second case suggests that,
although genetic factors may play a part, in
some cases the syndrome of infantile autism
appears to be a reversible one.  in view of
this set of twins and of kanner's sibling data,
the role of genetic factors remains obscure,
and more twin studies properly documented
with blood typing are needed.
.I 805
.W
evaluation and treatment planning
for autistic children
infantile autism is considered to be a re-
action on the part of an immature organism
at a primitive and undifferentiated stage of
ego development.  little choice of defensive
reactions is available; the possibility of sub-
limation does not exist and, even though
other object relationships are gradually
developing, the mother is still the child's
primary object.  at this vulnerable develop-
mental stage, a wide range of pathological
circumstances, ranging from the most severe
family psychopathology to the most adventi-
tious physiological traumata or the most un-
fortunately malignant circumstances, may
constitute an acute or cumulative cata-
strophic stress.  the primitive organism
tends to respond to this overwhelming stress
with a paranoid reaction which is directed at
the mother (regardless of the actual etiologi-
cal variables) because the mother is still the
child's primary object.  we believe that the
child then responds with an autistic reaction
and shows varying degrees of simple with-
drawal, obsessional behavior, magical or de-
lusional thought processes, and consequent
disruption of developmental skills, speech,
and relationships with others.
many families can and do make every
effort to counter the paranoid reaction of the
child and do not respond to his rejection with
counterrejection and counterwithdrawal.
some of the child's autistic symptoms may
abate without formal treatment.  yet, since
the mother (and family) are the primary
objects of the child's paranoid attitude, it is
felt that formal therapeutic intervention is
necessary to modify the paranoid core of
the autistic reaction.

a twenty-five year view of
therapeutic results
thus this group of ten patients shows a complete range of
chronic schizophrenia from a bright pseudoneurotic never hospitalized,
to an inaccessible patient chronically hospitalized for 20 years.
physiological therapy in the form of metrazol-induced convulsions
given in the course of a puberty schizophrenic psychosis, has been
helpful to some by making them more accessible for the total treat-
ment program in the hospital or by raising their margin of tolerance
sufficiently so that they could live at home and attend public schools
at least for a time and at best, indefinitely.
several of the most regressed, deteriorated patients in state hospitals
for many years, have been brought back to some level of meaningful
living again by the current drug therapy program, and are still im-
proving.
now we have not determined who the sinner may be.  there are
many who will believe that the mother is always the sinner; is she
not schizophrenogenic?  there are others who will believe that the
individual himself is the sinner since, after all, is he not the one
whose behavior and fantasies are schizophrenic?  however, there will
be many of you attending this fifty-second annual meeting of the
american psychopathological association, who will judge the speaker
to be the sinner, for have i not given you this wealth of clinical ma-
terial without charts, graphs, or statistical evaluation?

psychotic children and collateral
group therapy of their parents:
a preliminary report of the first two years
a group approach in the treatment of preschool-aged psychotic children is

group of children penetrates this defense and forms a "group ego," which
constitutes one pole of a new therapeutic symbiosis from which
separation-individuation can occur.

autistic reactions in early childhood:
differential diagnostic considerations
the term "autism" is frequently used today
in the differential diagnosis of the severe
emotional disturbances of early childhood.
however, to label a child as "autistic"
presents some formidable problems with
regard to definition of the term, the specific
etiological-diagnostic implications, and
treatment considerations for any given
child so designated.  the purpose of this
paper is to briefly review some of the
historical psychiatric background of the term
"autism", its more recent ramifications,
and our clinical experiences in this field.
.I 809
.W
infantile autism: a family approach
the autistic child appears to be unable to integrate or to respond to
stimuli, both from an internal source, the body, as well as from external
sources, such as human contact.  we have noted in the children at our
residential treatment center how in their preliminary period with us they
appear to be unaware of their body; they give the impression of being
insensitive to pain, display little autoerotic behavior, inflict injury on
themselves, such as hitting their heads against objects and biting their own
bodies, with little outward display of distress.  in working with these
children in therapy, one of the guideposts for change and for growth is a
display on the child's part of an increased body awareness and autoerotic
behavior.  for example, one child who developed polio during his early stay
at the clinic residence did not communicate this to anyone and it was only
made known by observing the child's dragging one leg (memorial guid-
ance clinic, 1959).  later, he was able to point to his body and to indicate
pain.  another child, who at first seemed to be quite unaware of both himself
and others, concurrent with his growing display of affective expression
toward the therapist also manifested pleasure through genital stimulation,
was quite ticklish, and when injured would display the area of pain quite
readily.

an analysis of the language of fourteen
schizophrenic children
fourteen schizophrenic (autistic) children were studied by means of detailed
behavioural histories and observations.
the language recorded in history and observation protocols was analysed and
compared with available data on normal children.
all schizophrenic children were grossly retarded in their language development
and all measures of this correlated highly with a previous overall clinical
assessment of the severity of illness.
the most striking abnormalities in the language of the children studied were
stereotyped repetition of utterances appropriate to an earlier developmental
level or to a previous environmental context, accompanied by a lack of normal
expressions of curiosity and of responsiveness to changing environmental cues.

a behavioural and electroencephalographic
study of autistic children
short biographies are given of 10 children,
age 3 to 6 years, diagnosed as suffering from
kanner's syndrome (early infantile autism).
an analysis was made of the free-field acti-
vities of these children compared with a group
of normal children of similar age.  electro-
encephalographic studies were also carried out
on all 10 children, and in two it was possible
to carry out simultaneous behavioural and
eeg observations by means of telemetry.
the children were observed for three minute
periods in four environments of varying
complexity: a. an empty room; b. the same
room with toy wooden blocks present; c.
blocks plus passive adult; d. blocks plus active
adult.  except in a the visual fixations and
manipulatory activities were of significantly
shorter duration in the autistic children than
in the normals, lacked clear 'cut-off' points
and showed relatively little variability between
environments.  the autistic children as a
whole showed virtually no constructive play in
contrast with the normals, though more
time was spent in contact with play materials in
the social environments.  changes in the
time spent in locomotion, gesturing, block-play
and manipulation of other objects in the
environment showed that the autistic children
were acutely responsive to changes in their
environment, including the presence of the social
stimulus.  if the autistic children were
subdivided into those who characteristically showed
stereotypies and those who did not, the
latter sub-group showed a behaviour structure which
was very similar to that of the normals,
whereas the stereotypy sub-group was clearly
differentiated from both the normal children
and the non-stereotypy sub-group.
eight autistic children had waking eeg
records characterized by low voltage irregular
activity without any established rhythms;
one child, a record containing irregular alpha
and another unstable theta activity.  two of
the children with 'flat' laboratory eegs showed
more rhythmic, higher voltage records when
their eegs were telemetred in environment a.
they also showed less stereotyped behaviour.
in environments b and d they showed pro-
gressively more irregular eeg activity and
more stereotypy.
the hypothesis is advanced that autistic
children are in a chronically high state of physio-
logical arousal.  the findings of the present
study and those of other workers are discussed
with respect to this hypothesis.
.I 812
.W
the autistic child in the school and the
school-nurse teacher responsibility
autistic children demonstrate a more persistent pattern of retreating
from reality than is apparent in those children categorized as normal.
some psychologists have established the cause of symptoms in the autistic
child as extreme anxiety which forces withdrawal from social contact.
such anxiety is reported to have its initial occurrance during the age
range of one to five years.  a sense of security which is considered es-
sential for a child is gained through overt manifestations of love, care and
approval of those adults most closely associated with him.  when this
need is not satisfied, the child's attempts at self-realization and esteem
are deterred or thwarted, and a state of anxiety may result.  the severity
of the anxiety may be the forerunner of a schizophrenic disorder.  such
a condition can develop in a child, an adolescent or an adult.  schizo-
phrenia, a serious mental illness, is considered to be a major cause for
admitting patients to mental institutions.
another school of thought has placed infantile autism in the category
of a disturbance resulting from abnormalities of development during the
intrauterine period.  such a congenital condition is not categorized as
mental retardation.
yet another concept of autism conceives of the problem as the absence
of an innate ability or capacity for developing meaningful contacts with
other people.  a detachment of varying degrees persists where human
contacts are concerned.
.I 813
.W
the autistic child
the conditions most frequently mistaken
for autism are speech disorder, brain damage
and mental deficiency, each a prominent
symptom of the psychotic child.  careful his-
tory and close observation to disclose symp-
toms of withdrawal, lack of ego, compulsion
for sameness, and displays of intelligence
give incomplete clues to the diagnosis.
the etiology of autism is uncertain.  sev-
eral factors seem significant.  the important
role of organic damage of the brain is under-
scored by the coincidence of epilepsy, eeg
and neurological abnormalities in these chil-
dren.  in our series seizures of various types
occurred in 25%, eeg abnormalities in 58%,
and minor neurological deficits in 70% of
the cases.  environmental factors are quite
obviously important in many instances.  the
emotional and behavioral pattern of the par-
ents toward the infant is often incriminated.
separation, inattention, coldness, rejection,
etc. have been found in many situations.  fa-
milial incidence of psychoses is low; so is
that of autism in siblings.

shadow therapy
shadow therapy was developed at sunland
training center in gainesville, florida, because of communica-
tion difficulties with disturbed, psychotic children.  it was con-
jectured that subjects would reveal their anxieties and conflicts
more readily in a simulated night situation.
the therapy was conducted in a darkroom with projector
light used to produce silhouettes and their accompanying
shadows as additional stimuli.  twelve subjects attended.  in
this article, the reaction of a child who was autistic and severely
disturbed is used as an illustration of subject reactions.  in the
playroom, he exhibited static behavior; in the darkroom, re-
gressive-transcendential behavior.  he also transcended his usual
level of vocalizing and socializing.

the convergence and interaction of visual,
auditory, and tactile responses in human
nonspecific cortex
the relation between the electrical responses in the human brain and
mental processes of integration and association is perhaps the most chal-
lenging of all the problems facing neurophysiologists today.  until quite
recently the prospect of unifying physiological and psychological concepts
by electro-encephalographic (eeg) techniques seemed to be receding
because of the baffling complexity of the intrinsic electrical rhythms, and
this difficulty has still not been overcome.  the most intriguing, and at
the same time most elusive, of the properties of these rhythms is that,
although often remarkably constant in their variations with respect to
time, they fluctuate also, in a much less regular manner, within the three
dimensional space of the brain.  the continuous analysis and display of
such a phenomenon presents serious difficulties, and no method has yet
given entirely satisfactory results.
the incentive to construct adequate equipment and to design and per-
form crucial experiments is undoubtedly limited by the uncertainty as
to whether the information likely to be obtained in this way is essential
to understanding brain mechanisms; few experimenters imagine that it
would be sufficient.

infantile autism and the schizophrenias
in a paper published in 1943, entitled "au-
tistic disturbances of affective con-
tact," i reported from the children's psychi-
atric service of the johns hopkins hospital
observations of 11 children (8 boys and 3
girls) who had in common a pattern of be-
havior not previously considered in its
striking uniqueness.  the symptoms were
viewed as a combination of extreme alone-
ness from the beginning of life and an anx-
iously obsessive desire for the preservation
of sameness.  i concluded the discussion by
saying: "we must assume that these chil-
dren have come into the world with an
innate inability to form the usual, biologi-
cally provided affective contact with people,
just as other children come into the world
with innate physical and intellectual handi-
caps.  if this assumption is correct, a further
study of our children may help to furnish
concrete criteria regarding the still diffuse
notions about the constitutional components
of emotional reactivity.  for here we seem to
have pure-culture examples of inborn au-
tistic disturbances of affective contact."
in my search for an appropriate designa-
tion, i decided in 1944, after much groping,
on the term early infantile autism, thus
accentuating the time of the first manifesta-
tions and the children's limited accessibility.

autistic children
autism is a form of childhood schizophrenia.  a sudden
separation from his mother or traumatic shock in
early life causes the child to reject the world of nor-
mal relationships.  leading him back to the original
traumatic situation is part of the treatment described
in this article.

psychodrama for disturbed children
psychodrama is especially adaptable to the treat-
ment of mentally ill children.  it evokes a degree
of spontaneity and involvement that is difficult to
attain with many group therapies, and it offers situa-
tions in which the children can participate as actors
or as observers.  competition and restriction are
minimal: the child can do what comes naturally.  in-
deed, much of children's natural play is in the form
of dramatic activity.  their make-believe is, how-
ever, more intense than acting, for a child becomes
the person or thing he pretends to be: a fireman,
an indian, a horse, a tiger.

the speech and language abilities of
emotionally disturbed children
the speech and language disorders of
these severely disturbed children can be
divided into two categories which relate
to the type of psychiatric disturbance.
the autistic-schizophrenic children used
bizarre forms of language or did not use
communicative language at all.  the non-
autistic-schizophrenic, the neurotic, the
primary behaviour disorder, and the
minimally brain-damaged children as a
group, had similar speech and language
problems to normal children but of a
more severe and frequent nature.  their
problems were predominantly in the
areas of speech and language develop-
ment, articulation, rate of speech and
fluency.  the children with primary be-
haviour disorders had the more severe
speech and language problems.

following a period of observation of
three months' duration, a group of twelve
autistic schizophrenic children were se-
lected for a treatment program.  the
group was selected on criteria which
would allow a reasonable chance of suc-
cessful treatment in a group homo-
geneous enough to allow statistical con-
siderations to be valid.
younger age, average intellectual func-
tioning, presence of an intact family in
or near to metropolitan toronto and a
firm diagnosis of autistic schizophrenia
were the limiting factors.
rather distinct differences were noted
in this treatment group as opposed to the
larger observation group.  the dis-
tinguishing characteristic was undoubted-
ly the speech abnormalities present.

the effect of joint position on the pressure

it is known that joints with symptomatic effusions are held spontaneously in

haemophilic blood cyst
a mongol boy of ten, a known haemophiliac, was seen in the orthopaedic
department of southmead hospital in may 1962 with a swelling of the left foot.
the parents were aware of a steady increase in size since the swelling was
first noticed two months before.  on examination, a cystic swelling was seen to
occupy the forefoot, the skin on the dorsum being stretched over it and a
dusky red in colour (fig. 1).  radiographs showed destruction of the proximal
two-thirds of the third metatarsal bone, an appearance consistent, it was
thought with destruction from within by an expanding lesion (fig. 2).  the
diagnosis of a haemophilic blood cyst was made.

treatment and prevention of chronic haemorrhagic
arthropathy and contractures in haemophilia
orthopaedic treatment of joint deformities in thirteen patients with
haemophilia is reviewed over a period of seven years.
forms of treatment discussed include open operation, manipulation under general
anaesthesia, continuous traction, splintage and physiotherapy.  the amount of
intravenous therapy required for each form of treatment is indicated.
in discussing prevention of joint deformity the histories of a further eighteen
patients have been taken into account.  it is concluded that initially painless
haemarthroses provide the main threat to joint deformity in haemophilia.
the best preventive treatment is early immobilisation followed by prolonged
splintage and physiotherapy; intravenous therapy with antihaemophilic factor
plays a less important role here than in other forms of haemorrhage.
evidence is presented that joint deformity in severe haemophilia can often be
entirely avoided.

cautery should not be used in an infected wound of

vii. incidence, treatment and prophylaxis of
arthropathy and other musculo-skeletal
manifestations of haemophilia a and b
the clinical material consisted of 242 of the 308 known haemophiliacs
(a and b) in sweden.  the investigation included clinical examination of
all major joints in 95 of 116 patients with severe haemophilia, in 38 of
65 patients with moderate haemophilia, and in 24 of 127 patients with
mild haemophilia, and roentgen examination of practically all joints
found to be abnormal at the clinical examination.  in addition information
about 7 patients with severe haemophilia, 21 with moderate haemophilia,
and 57 with mild haemophilia was obtained by questionnaire only.
the degree of arthropathy (grades 2, 3 and 4) was classified largely
according to depalma and cotler (1956).  evaluation of general disability
was made with regard to ability to manage (walk, dress, eat, toilet) with-
out help.  this latter evaluation comprised also extra-articular manifesta-

irradiation had no harmful effect on growth of
patients; it was beneficial in two thirds of the cases,
reducing considerably the number per annum of
haemarthrosis onsets; one third of the patients
showed no significant result: the number of onsets
was the same in the following year.

professor marchal acts as moderator.
dr. le coeur wonders if the fringed appearance of
condyles has really a pathological significance; that
appearance could be normal in young children, but,
in the opinion of dr. queneau, it seems to be patho-
logical in older children.
it seems to dr. favre-gilly and dr. queneau that
scalariform traits occur more frequently in haemo-
philiac children than in normal ones.
dr. le coeur thought that fibrillary decalcification
was the ultimate stage of decalcification, whereas
dr. favre-gilly has the impression that it represents
in haemophiliac subjects an early stage anterior to
homogeneous decalcification.
according to brinkhous, densification of synovial
membranes are a result of an infiltration of the joint
cartilage due to haemosideraemia; this is also the
opinion of dr. favre-gilly and dr. izarn.
dr. izarn asks if geodes are caused by intra-
osseous haemorrhages or necroses; dr. queneau and
dr. de mourgues think that anatomical data con-
cerning haemophiliac subjects are insufficient for
that question to be answered.

radiographic examination of the knee were syste-
matically performed in 100 haemophiliac subjects
aged from 7 to 15 years, 64 of whom had a bilateral
haemarthrosis, 30 had only one knee affected and
6 were uninjured.
an intra-articular opacification, observed in
29 knees, corresponded to a recent haemarthrosis.
densification of the synovial membrane was ob-
served in 25 knees and corresponded to iron
deposits.
an interlinear pinch was present in 52 knees.
erosions of articular surfaces are especially fre-
quent (78 knees) or homogeneous (28 knees).
hypertrophy of condyles or knee-caps, broadening
of intercondylian space, crushing of internal tibial
disk, genu valgum and posterior subluxation of tibia
are osseous deformations that are encountered.
atrophy of femur diaphysis explains the frequency
of fracture of femur.
some of these aspects seem to occur early (inter-
linear pinch, erosion of the surfaces), others are
tardier (geodes, decalcification).
a relation between the intensity of abnormal radio-
logical findings and the severity of sequelae does
not always exist, but one can observe major radio-
logical alterations only when there is a major bio-
logical disturbance.

volkmann's ischaemia
volkmann's ischaemia is the name given to a sequence
of events originally described by volkmann in 1881.
basically the condition consists of the replacement of
the limb flexor muscles by fibrous tissue following injury or
occlusion of the main arterial supply of blood to these
muscles.  the condition is rare fortunately--mainly because
of improved methods of prevention.  the flexor muscles of
the toes are sometimes affected, but the commonest group of
muscles so damaged are the flexor muscles of the forearm.
total arterial occlusion to a limb for several hours usually
causes frank gangrene; partial or total occlusion for shorter
periods may give rise to ischaemic contracture.  the muscles,
being deprived of their blood supply, die and are sub-
sequently replaced by fibrous tissue.  like all scars, the fibrous
tissue contracts, producing the complete picture of
volkmann's ischaemic contracture.  the forearm is thin and
wasted, and the fingers are held in flexion owing to the
overall shortening of the flexor muscles.  in severe cases, if
the nerves are also affected or if the entire muscle mass is
replaced by fibrosis, the fingers may be totally paralysed
as well.

the prevention of crippling
in haemophilic children
children who are severely affected with haemo-
philia or christmas disease suffer repeated
haemorrhages into joints and muscles after trivial
injuries.  these episodes of bleeding produce
cumulative crippling.  the haemarthroses tend to be
recurrent; each episode produces some damage to
the joint surface and the immobility during con-
valescence leads to muscle weakness.  thus after
recovery the joint becomes increasingly liable to
renewed bleeding.  the deep muscle haematomata
can produce crippling by actual destruction of
muscle tissue, by pressure on important nerves or
arteries, by contractures which develop during
healing and by failure of resolution of the original
haematoma leading to chronic cyst formation.

hemophilic arthropathy
jaromir priborsky, zora antalovska
the authors report their experience with joint
diseases in 54 patients suffering from hemo-
philia, 49 of them being cases of hemophilia a,
5 of hemophilia b.  21 patients were children
up to the age of 14 years.  bleeding into the joints
occurred in 66.6% of patients.  in the age
group over 14 years the cases of bleeding into
the joints were more frequent (78.8%) than
in the age group up to 14 years (47.7%).
there were no differences as to bleeding into the
joints and the seriousness of articular changes
between the cases of hemophilia a and hemo-
philia b.  in most cases the bleeding into the
joints began between the 6th and the 14th year
of age.  bleeding into the joints as the first
manifestation of a hemophilic condition occurred
only in 9.3% of patients; in most cases other
hemophilic manifestations preceded.  in spite of
this fact the joint manifestations were often
wrongly diagnosed as tuberculous arthritis, rheumatic
fever, progressive arthritis, and were treated
accordingly.  most usually the large joints (knee,
elbow, ankle) were affected with bleeding and in
them the changes were also the most serious.  the
joints of both halves of the body were
affected uniformly.  in most cases several joints were
affected while monoarticular localization
was observed in 16.6%.  the seriousness of articular
changes was dependent mainly on the
number of repeated bleedings into one and the same
joint, although other factors (weight bearing
of the joint, complexity of the joint, treatment) may be
of decisive importance in the individual
cases as well.
according to clinical (especially from
the functional point of view) and x-ray criteria the
articular findings were classified into three
groups: in the first group the function of the joint
is preserved, in the second limited and
in the third practically extinguished.  the following
laboratory tests were carried out: erythrocyte
sedimentation reaction, latex test for the rheu-
matoid factor, c-reactive protein, mecoprotein
tyrosine and weltmann's coagulation test.
the findings were normal even in cases of
irreparable articular changes unless acute bleeding
into the joint or in some other localization,
or some other complicating disorder was present
simultaneously.
the therapy of hemophilic arthropathy
remains troublesome owing especially to a frequent
occurrence of articular bleeding.
a close cooperation of the hematologist
and the rheumatologist or the orthopedist may con-
tribute to the improvement of the fate of
these patients.

aspects of circadian periodic changes in
phosphorus metabolism in mice
kinetic studies on the p32 content of
mouse brain phosphorus fractions following
the intraperitoneal injection of p32-labeled
orthophosphate were performed during
two selected segments of the 24-hour time scale.
the results of these studies suggest
that the circadian periodicity in relative
specific activity of brain phospholipids
is probably a consequence of a variation in the extent
of p32 incorporation into brain
inorganic phosphate and is not indicative
of a periodicity in the rate of intermediary
phospholipid metabolism.  data on the postinjection
time course of the specific activities
of plasma inorganic phosphate, liver inorganic phosphate,
and liver phospholipid
suggest a similar explanation for
the circadian periodic changes in relative
specific activity of liver phospholipids.
a circadian rhythm of inorganic phosphate
concentration in mouse plasma is demonstrated.
consideration of a mathematical
model suggests that the observed within-day
variation in p32 distribution and the
circadian periodicity of phospholipid relative
specific activity in liver and brain
are a consequence of this periodicity in
plasma phosphate content.  a significant
within-day variation in total phosphorus
content of liver was observed.  the disturbance
of mice incident to p32 injection
has a marked effect on the plasma content
of inorganic phosphate and corticosterone.

the renal mechanism and tubular site of the phosphaturic action of

techniques in one intact and seven thyroparathyroidectomized
dogs.  administration of hormone caused a significant increase
in the excretion of phosphate without increasing the filtered
load.  stop-flow analysis indicated that in the absence of parathyroid
hormone most of the filtered phosphate was reabsorbed
in the proximal tubule, and that the hormone increased the
rate of phosphate excretion by inhibiting this reabsorptive
mechanism.  p32 injected during stopped flow showed no significant
transport across the renal tubule despite the presence of
excess parathyroid hormone.  significant p32 activity appeared
in the stop-flow collections simultaneously with the appearance
of new filtrate.  there was no evidence that parathyroid hormone
mediated a secretory process for phosphate excretion.

the regulation of growth hormone secretion

gh. the assumption, implied throughout this
presentation, that changes in
secretory rate are responsible for acute
changes in plasma concentration of
hgh appears reasonable since the
fluctuations in plasma hgh concentration
are often too rapid to be caused solely by
alterations in hormonal
degradation or excretion.  for slower changes
in plasma hgh concentration,
however, alterations in the rate of removal
of hormone from the body fluids
might play a contributory role.  however,
there is no evidence that important
changes occur in the rate of removal of
hgh from the circulation except in
patients who have developed antibodies
to hgh following treatment with hgh.

early infantile autism and receptor processes
the syndrome of early infantile autism is examined
as a function of deviation in
near-distance receptor usage.  these receptor
deviations are compared with normal
receptor hierarchies developing from near
to distance receptor dominance.  the
available information is consistent with the
view that early infantile autism involves
early sensory deprivation.  this sensory
deprivation results from an interaction
between a constitutional deficiency inhibiting
certain reticular arousal functions
and mothering tending to understimulation.
treatment of the young autistic child is suggested
including stimulation and communication
via the available near receptor
systems.  in the framework of sensory development,
directions for the study of early
diagnosis and treatment are indicated.

studies on compensatory renal hypertrophy.  i.  effect of
unilateral ureteral ligation and transection
data are presented comparing the relative rate
of compensatory renal hypertrophy
and hyperplasia of the control kidney of rats
following either unilateral ureteral
transection, ligation, or nephrectomy.  the growth
of the control kidney on the unoperated
side was strikingly slower after ureteral
transection and ligation when
compared with that resulting from the removal
of one kidney.  progressive hydronephrosis
was observed on the operated side following
ureteral transection and
ligation and was more pronounced in the latter.
degree of hypertrophy of the control
kidney showed a close correlation with degree and
duration of the hydronephrosis of
the kidney on the operated side.  these observations
have been interpreted as indicating
the operation of a control system regulating
kidney growth in response to
changes in some way related to kidney size.

studies of the changes in growth
and dna synthesis in the rat kidney
during experimentally induced
renal hypertrophy
there is a high rate of accumulation of
newly synthesized dna in the kidney after folic
acid injection, compared with the small increase
during the first few days after unilateral nephrectomy.
there is a large increase in the water content
of the kidney after folic acid which does not
occur after unilateral nephrectomy.  the changes
in the wet and dry weight and the rna and dna
content of the kidney have been compared after
administration of folic acid, unilateral nephrectomy
and unilateral nephrectomy followed by folic
acid 24 hr later in an attempt to study the nature
of these differences.  after unilateral nephrectomy
there was a steady increase in wet weight, dry
weight and rna content of the kidney, each parameter
reaching about 35 to 40% above normal by
14 days, by which time the dna content had increased
by only about 25%.  an increased rate of
dna synthesis was found between 2 and 4 days,
returning almost to normal by 7 days.  after folic
acid injection there were very large increases in
wet weight (60%), rna content (100%) and dna content
(70%) during the first 4 days accompanied by
a smaller increase in dry weight (30%).  thereafter
these parameters declined, relative to body weight,
returning almost to normal by 14 days.  the rate
of dna synthesis was greatly increased as early
as 24 hr after injection and reached a much higher
level than that found after unilateral nephrectomy,
before returning to the normal level by 7 days.
when unilateral nephrectomy was followed 24 hr
later by folic acid injection, the increases in
weight, nucleic acid content and rate of dna synthesis
were greater than at the corresponding
times after either treatment alone.  marked differences
were found in the labeling indices of kidney
cells after either unilateral nephrectomy or folic
acid injection.  the latter treatment resulted in very
large increases in all three zones of the kidney,
whereas after unilateral nephrectomy the responses
of the cortex and outer medulla were much lower,
with no significant increase in the inner medulla.
when both treatments were combined, the response
of the remaining kidney was similar to, though
more exaggerated than, that of the normal kidney
after folic acid injection.

renal and adrenal relationships
in compensatory hyperplasia
the compensatory renal hyperplasia that
normally follows unilateral nephrectomy
is abolished by bilateral adrenalectomy if
rats are maintained on fresh drinking
water, but is restored when saline drinking
water is provided or if such animals are
injected with doca.  the adrenals are also
important for the increased proliferation
caused by unilateral hydronephrosis.  these
experiments suggest that the role of the
adrenal cortex in renal hyperplasia may be to
secrete mineralocorticoids, which
promote the retention of sodium and thereby
stimulate cell division in the kidneys.

a genetic study of neonatal obstructive jaundice
58 children with extrahepatic biliary atresia, 7 with intrahepatic

concerning diagnostic criteria, natural history, familial, clinical
and pathological data.  in extrahepatic biliary atresia, there is no
evidence of a familial tendency, influence of maternal age, birth
order or disturbance of foetal development.  in 'neonatal hepatitis',
there were 4 consanguineous parents, suggesting a mutant
autosomal gene in homozygous form.  some infants with the genotype
for 'neonatal hepatitis' may manifest a very mild or a very severe
form, so, a diagnosis was not made.  an apparent excess of males
over females may be another evidence of failure of manifestation of
the genotype.  but 'neonatal hepatitis' may be a manifestation of
more than one disease.  in 'neonatal hepatitis' the birth weight
shows a marked decrease, perhaps as a sequence of disturbed liver
function in the foetus.

parathyroid extract-induced changes in the oxidation of citrate,
succinate and other organic acids by liver.
parathyroid extract (pte) or partially
purified parathyroid hormone administered in
vivo markedly altered the oxidation
in vitro by rabbit liver minces of citrate, -keto
glutarate-c, succinate-c, fumarate-c
and lactate.  with ca ++ present in the
incubation medium, minces from pte
treated animals produced more co and had
a greater o consumption than did control
minces.  this stimulation was due, in part
at least, to a more rapid decline in metabolic
activity of the control tissues.  when
ca++ was absent, total metabolism was
increased and the tissue derived from pte
treated animals was less active than the
control tissue.  the effect was detected as
early as 4 hr after injection (750 u/kg)
and could be elicited with as little as 200 u
(at 14 hr).  the action of pte could not
be duplicated by the injection of cacl into
the animal.  the data suggest that one effect
of treatment was a general inhibition of
oxidation.  the stimulation of metabolism
could be a consequence of this inhibition
or a separate unrelated alteration.

actinomycin and erythropoiesis and the production of erythropoietin in
mice.
in b6d2f female mice a single dose of 10
of actinomycin will suppress normal
erythropoiesis (fe erythrocyte uptake).  in
polycythemic mice 2 is enough to
prevent the stimulatory effect of 0.25 a units
of erythropoietin.  the curves of suppression
and recovery versus time support the
hypothesis that erythropoietin acts
for a short time in an early stage of
erythropoiesis; after this early stage developing
cells are no longer so sensitive to actinomycin.
recovery, even from repeated
doses, is rapid and adequate.  amounts of
actinomycin which are adequate to abolish
erythropoiesis do not prevent the new appearance
of erythropoietin in the plasma of

days and compared to untreated controls.
in both the pregnant and nonpregnant cows
the parathyroid glands became markedly
atrophic with a diminution in the amount of
parenchyma compared to the untreated controls.
after vit d feeding the number of
actively secreting dark and intermediate
chief cells was reduced and the percentage
of inactive (light) and atrophic chief cells
was increased.  the parathyroid glands
of the vit d-fed, nonpregnant cows were
dominated by severely atrophic chief cells.
these cells were characterized by their
highly irregular shape, shrunken nucleus
and cytoplasm, widened intercellular spaces
traversed by numerous cytoplasmic
processes, increased electron density, few
secretory granules, inactive ergastoplasm
and golgi complexes.  atrophic chief
cells were not present in the untreated
controls.  the predominating cell type in
the parathyroids of the vit d-fed pregnant
cows were the inactive chief cells.  in contrast
to the atrophic chief cells, they were
larger and more regular in shape with
relatively straight cell membranes.  they
were comparatively electron-transparent,
containing more glycogen and fewer
secretory granules.  organelles concerned
with protein synthesis and packaging into
secretory units were poorly developed.
inactive chief cells were observed only
occasionally in the parathyroid glands of
untreated pregnant cows where the actively
secreting dark and intermediate chief cells
predominated.

effect of heparin and parathyroid extract an acid phosphatase in bone.
   to test the theory that heparin
might stimulate acid
phosphatase in the bone of
young rats, heparin, pte,
or a combination of both were
injected.  after an appropriate
time interval acid phosphatase
activity of bone of
treated animals was compared
with controls.  it was
found that heparin enhanced
the pte-stimulated acid
phosphatase activity of both
calvaria and metaphysis but
not diaphysis.  the possible
relation of these facts to
the presence of lysosomes in
osteoclasts was discussed.

the isolation of thyrocalcitonin and study of its effects in the rat.
   the thyroid secretes a
polypeptide hormone (thyrocalcitionin)
which is effective
in lowering plasma calcium
and phosphate.  the hormone
can be extracted from
the thyroid of the rat, dog,
pig, goat, ox, and monkey.
the isolation of the hormone
from pig thyroid by a combination
of salt fractionation
and gel filtration is described.
one microgram of
the pure material is very
active in the rat.  thyrocalcitonin
remains effective after
parathyroidectomy, after
nephrectomy, after overdosage
with vitamin d, during vitamin
d deficiency, and during
calcium or magnesium deficiency.
its action is not prevented
by prior administration
of actinomycin d.  a
single injection does not change
soft tissue calcium but
infusion for 12 hr lowers cardiac
muscle calcium.  it is
concluded that this new thyroid
hormone acts on bone
and that it probably plays an
important role in normal physiology.

the effect of actinomycin d on parathyroid-induced
change in bone and kidney.
actinomycin d (amd), an antibiotic known to
inhibit dna-directed rna synthesis,
was used to study parathyroid-induced changes
in ca mobilization in vivo and in vitro
as well as renal excretion of ca and phosphate
in rats.  intact and parathyroidectomized
rats subjected to peritoneal lavage were
administered amd, and changes in
ca, p, and mg in lavage and serum were
examined.  amd consistently lowered the
ca transfer into the peritoneal rinse in both
the intact and parathyroidectomized animals,
although the drop in ca was more acute
if the animals were pretreated by subcutaneous
injections of amd than if amd was
administered as a component of the
rinse.  pretreatment of lavaged animals with
amd prevented the expected increase
in osteoclast numbers in the distal metaphysis
of the femur but had no effect if administered
as a component of the peritoneal rinse.
the incubation of femora removed
from both intact and parathyroidectomized
animals resulted in media ca levels that
were significantly lower after 4 hr. incubation
when amd was added in vitro.  however,
transfer of recently injected ca into
the incubation medium from animals
treated with amd was increased.  in addition,
parathyroidectomy of animals subsequent
to administration of amd still resulted
in expected changes in ca and p in the
urine although amd significantly increased p
excretion in both intact and parathyroidectomized
animals.  it was concluded that
endogenous parathyroid hormone requires
the continuous production of enzymes ultimately
responsible for its action on bone
and kidney, but that this action is not necessarily
related directly to the production
of m-rna.

inhibition by actinomycin d of bone resorption
induced by parathyroid hormone or vitamin a.
actinomycin d inhibits cell proliferation in
control cultures of embryonic rat bone
and prevents the stimulation of bone resorption
by parathyroid horome (pth) or vit.
a.  with a dose of 0.004 /ml. of actinomycin
d, pth effects are only partially inhibited
and this inhibition can be overcome
by increasing the dose of pth.  these

j. clin. endocr. 1965, 25/4 (457-464).
antagonism between parathyroid extract and adrenal
cortical steroids in man.
metabolic balance studies were done in 2
patients with hypoparathyroidism who
received hydrocortisone of prednisone
during the administration of parathyroid
extract.  administration of prednisone was
associated with phosphate retention,
decreased urinary ca, decreased serum
ca, citrate and glycoprotein concentrations,
and increased serum phosphate.
excretion of parathyroid activity in the
urine of 1 patient was uninfluenced by the
administration of prednisone.  it is concluded
that the antagonistic effect of the
adrenal cortical steroids was expressed
at the biochemical sites of action of the
parathyroid extract in bone and kidney,
that the steroids reduce parathyroid secretion
but that their administration probably does not
result in degradation or inactivation of
the hormone.

tissue distribution of electrolytes, ca and mg in experimental
hyper- and hypoparathyroidism.
the effects of experimental hyper- and
hypoparathyroidism on plasma and tissue
distribution of electrolytes and tissue
exchangeability with ca and mg were studied
in dogs following acute renal pedicle
ligation.  in hyperparathyroidism, plasma concentrations
of mg and inorganic p as
well as ca were increased.  a greater accumulation
of ca occurred in some tissues
and a lesser accumulation in others than
in acute hypercalcemia of comparable
severity and the fractional rate of exchange
of tissue ca was 30% more rapid than
in control and acute hypercalcemic dogs.
bone exchange of ca was not significantly
increased.  cell mg concentrations were
not appreciably altered by hyperparathyroidism
except for a significant 9% decrease
in myocardium, but the fractional rate
of exchange of tissue mg was increased.
acidsoluble p concentrations were decreased
in 3 tissues and na and c1 concentrations
were decreased by 10 to 25% in 4 tissues.
in hypoparathyroidism, in addition to a
decreased plasma ca, the increment
in plasma inorganic p that usually occurs
after renal pedicle ligation was 75% less
than in control dogs.  cell ca concentrations
were decreased by 10-40% but the
fractional rate of exchange of tissue ca was
unaltered.  although cell mg concentrations
were unaltered a 40% increase occurred
in the exchangeability of skeletal muscle
mg.  tissue na and c1 concentrations were
decreased by 20% in 2 tissues.  it has been
previously reported that hypercalcemia
increases cell ca concentrations by raising
the extracellular ca concentration gradient.
evidence has also been presented that
hypercalcemia directly inhibits cell
influx of mg and na and cell efflux of k.
with altered parathyroid activity, 2 types
of effects are observed: those which are
dependent upon an abnormal extracellular
ca concentration and those which appear to
be due to intrinsic effects of parathormone
on cell cation transport.  the present
data are compatible with the hypotheses
that parathormone stimulates bidirectional
transport of cell ca and p, stimulates
cell influx of mg and opposes the effects of
hypercalcemia on cell transport of univalent ions.

the inhibition of respiration and phosphorylation in kidney
mitochondria by parathyroid hormone administered in vivo.
   parathyroid hormone administered
in vivo to rabbits
produced a metabolic alteration
in kidney cortex
mitochondria, evidenced by
diminished respiratory rate,
respiratory control, and p:o
ratio with a series of substrates
including pyruvate plus
fumarate, succinate,
ketoglutarate, malate, citrate,
and isocitrate.  the adenosine
triphosphate-inorganic
phosphate exchange reaction
rate was decreased and
adenosine triphosphatase
activity was increased compared
to control mitochondria.
these changes did not become
apparent until about 12 hr.
after injection, were undiminished
by 24 hr., and could
be elicited with as little as 200
usp units of hormone.
under identical conditions liver
mitochondria were unaffected.
diphospho- and triphosphopyridine nucleotides
in combination frequently elevated
the respiration in
parathyroid-treated mitochondria
close to or above control
levels with citrate and isocitrate
but not with the
remaining substrates and had
no effect on respiratory
control with any of the substrates.
the effects of the
hormone could not be duplicated
by elevating and maintaining
in otherwise normal rabbits
serum ca concentrations
at twice normal level
for 6 hr. it is concluded
that the effects produced by
parathyroid hormone on kidney
are multiple in nature and
related to the ca++
raising potency of the preparations.

sudden hypocalcemia in normal and hypoparathyroid subjects.
   serum calcium concentration was suddenly decreased
in 10 normal and 4 hypoparathyroid subjects
by the infusion of 50 mg/kg of disodium edta over a
30- to 45-minute interval.  the return rate to pre-infusion
values of the serum calcium concentration was the
same in both groups.  serum phosphate showed a marked,
transient decrease 30 min after the infusion in normal
individuals, but not in those with hypoparathyroidism.
the hypophosphatemia was followed by a marked
increase in phosphate clearance in the normal group and
a decrease in the hypoparathyroid group.  urine phosphate:
urine creatinine x 10 (up:uc x 10) and urine
phosphate: urine osmolality x 10 (up:uo x 10) ratios
also reflected an increased phosphate excretion in the
2 groups.  a simple clinical measure of parathyroid
function is suggested by determining the up:uo x 10
or the up:uc x 10, or both, ratios before and 3 to 6
hr after intravenous infusion of disodium edta.

parathyroid function in chronic renal failure.  a statistical survey
of the plasma biochemistry in azotaemic renal osteodystrophy.
   a collection has been made of 134 personal and
published cases of azotemic osteodystrophy in which
adequate information was available concerning the
pathological state of the bones.  measurements were
available of the plasma calcium, plasma phosphate, and
blood-urea-nitrogen in all cases, and of plasma bicarbonate
and plasma proteins in a representative sample.
the plasma levels of calcium and phosphate in the whole
series of 134 cases were not related reciprocally but
were correlated directly.  these data were further analyzed
by allocating each case to either of 2 sub-groups,
according to the type of pathological lesions present in
the bones.  in one group there was evidence of defective
mineralization of skeletal tissues, in the form of either
rickets or osteomalacia, and the plasma-calcium was
found to be statistically sub-normal.  in the other group
there was no primary defect of mineralization but the
lesions of generalized osteitis fibrosa were present and
the plasma calcium was statistically normal.  there was
no significant correlation between the plasma levels of
calcium and phosphate in either sub-group; and the plasma
phosphate was significantly higher in the group with
the higher plasma calcium levels.  the data indicate that
in patients with renal osteodystrophy, contrary to general
belief, the plasma calcium varies independently of the
plasma phosphate.  since these results imply differences
in parathyroid function among patients with azotemic
osteodystrophy, a survey has also been made of
the recorded parathyroid weights in chronic renal failure.
generalized osteitis fibrosa and the accompanying normal
levels of plasma calcium are associated with greater
parathyroid hypertrophy than is found in most cases
of chronic renal failure or cases with defective mineralization.
the various data are interpreted in relation
to the known metabolic disturbances and natural history
of azotemic osteodystrophy.  by analogy with states of
simple vitamin d deficiency, it is suggested that hypocalcemia
and relative unresponsiveness to the calcemic
action of parathyroid hormone are related to an acquired
resistance to vitamin d.  the group of cases with statistically
normal plasma-calcium prove that the parathyroid
glands can function effectively in some patients
with chronic renal failure, irrespective of the level of
the plasma phosphate.  the size of the glands and the
effects of sub-total parathyroidectomy in patients of this
group suggest that the normal plasma calcium results
from an increased production of parathyroid hormone.
the more advanced renal failure in the normocalcemic,
as compared with the hypocalcemic, cases could mean
that the development of an effective degree of secondary
hyperparathyroidism is a function of the duration of the
renal disease.  it seems likely that when the parathyroid
response is sufficient to overcome the effects of the vitamin
d resistance it also entails the development of generalized
osteitis fibrosa, healing of the defect of mineralization
and increased liability to metastatic calcification.

albright's hereditary osteodystrophy.  report of a family with studies
of bone remodeling.
   two members of a single family, each representing
different forms of albright's hereditary osteodystrophy,
have been presented.  the kindred pattern is
similar to those of other reported families and is consistent
with a sex-linked or autosomal dominant mode of
inheritance.  the importance of a course of intramuscular
parathyroid extract for proof of parathyroid hormone
resistance is emphasized.  biopsy specimens of rib,
labeled in vivo with tetracycline, were studied microscopically.
these new observations indicated cellular
defects in bone remodeling shared by the propositus and
case 2, which may explain the low rates of bone turnover
found in each.  immunologic studies established the
presence of a substance antigenically similar to parathyroid
hormone in the parathyroid tissue of the propositus.
the pathogenesis of albright's hereditary osteodystrophy
and atypical forms of parathyroid hormone
resistant hypocalcemia is discussed.

acute hyperparathyroidism: a surgical emergency.
   acute hypercalcemic crisis of hyperparathyroidism
is a surgical emergency.  diagnosis is often difficult
because of the polymorphous character of the
symptoms.  the variable clinical features of the syndrome
are described emphasizing the frequent occurrence of
gastrointestinal symptoms, especially duodenal ulcer of
recurring pancreatitis in the antecedent history as well
as the better known occurrence of renal and skeletal
manifestations, which precede the crisis in all but a few
cases.  despite the variability of the clinical manifestations,
the total syndrome forms a distinctive pattern
which should be recognizable once it is known.  previously
reported cases have been reviewed and an additional
case reported.  the differential diagnosis, aids
in identification of the tumor and prospects for more
effective control of the hypercalcemia are discussed.
at the present time, early surgical removal of the tumor
is the only effective treatment.

actinomycin d inhibition of intestinal transport of calcium and
of vitamin d action.
   actinomycin d injection inhibits the actions of vit d
in increasing concentrative transport of ca across the
intestinal wall in vitro and in raising serum ca concentrations
of fasted vit d-deficient rats.  actinomycin d blocks
the transport of ca across the mucosal surface of vit d
deficient as well as vit d-treated rats so that its action is
on the ca transport system, rather than on the stimulatory
effect of vit d.  this inhibitory effect of actinomycin d on
ca transport is present within 3 hr of its s. c. injection
and is less marked at 18 hr which suggests a direct interaction
with the ca transport system.  under the same conditions
actinomycin d does not influence the transport of
1-tyrosine across the intestinal wall in vitro.

radiation therapy of pituitary tumors can
cause necrosis of the brain (4 cases are reported),
particulary if a carefully considered schedule of

   experiences with hgh treatment of twelve hypopituitary
dwarfs for periods varying from 6 to 41 months
are reported.  all the patients were considered to have
hypopituitarism from birth, four of them of the hereditary
type, four possibly due to traumatic birth or neonatal asphyxia,
and four from an unknown cause.  in six
patients detailed information concerning growth during
the first year of life could be obtained.  all of these patients
had a degree of growth retardation before one
year of age.  we consider this to be the rule rather than
the exception in pituitary dwarfism.  the most important
diagnostic evidence was a marked degree of growth retardation
accompanied by a pronounced delay in skeletal
maturation, and, in most cases, signs of secondary
hypothyroidism, increased insulin sensitivity, and a
poor response to metopyrone administration.  none of
the patients who had passed the normal age of puberty
had maturated sexually.  all twelve patients responded
well to hgh therapy.  during the first year of treatment
the average height increment was 10 cm. ('catch-up' growth).
with continued treatment a normal rate of
growth, about 6 cm./year, was obtained.  there was no
disproportionate acceleration of skeletal maturation in
any of the patients.  none of them has so far become resistant
to hgh administration.  the oldest patient has
reached normal height.  whether this will be possible
not only in the moderately severe, but also in the most
severe cases of pituitary dwarfism, can not yet be stated.

treatment of short stature in children and adolescents
with human pituitary growth hormone (raben).  experience
with thirty-five cases.
human pituitary growth hormone (raben) was
evaluated by longitudinal study of
growth as a therapeutic agent in the treatment
of short stature.  clinically significant
increases in growth rate were achieved in 11
of 13 hypopituitary patients.  no significant
improvement in linear growth rate was
noted with a dose of 2 mg 3 times
weekly in children whose short stature was due
to other conditions.  no adverse reactions
were noted; thyroidal, adrenal or gonadal
activation was not observed.  growth
was stimulated, probably without an undue increase
in bone age, though this point
demands continued scrutiny.  owing to the limited
supply of this material it is recommended
that it be used only in cases of documented
growth failure, and a protocol
for evaluation of therapeutic response is discussed.
though not a panacea for treatment
of short stature, human growth hormone
fulfils a unique and invaluable role
in replacement therapy for the hypopituitary dwarf.

the development of bilateral adenomatous adrenal hyperplasia
in a case of cushing's syndrome of eighteen years' duration.
a case of cushing's syndrome of 18 years'
duration is presented.  the disease
began when the patient was 8 years old and
was partially controlled by pituitary
radiation when she was 13.  however, clinical
evidence indicate low grade but continuous
adrenocortical activity for the next 13
years.  the probable suppression
of gh secretion by the increased steroid levels
during her growth period provides
a reasonable explanation for the dwarfism of
the patient.  the administration of 8 mg
of dexamethasone per day failed to decrease
urinary steroid excretion.  bilateral
nodular hyperplasia was found at surgery.
it is suggested from the evidence presented
that this patient's disease began first
as a primary pituitary process but
during the long duration of the acth secretion
it evolved into one of autonomously
functioning bilateral nodular hyperplasia.

hypopituitarism: a study of growth
hormone and other endocrine functions.
   pituitary function was evaluated in 25 adults with
evidence of hypopituitarism or enlargement of the sella
turcica.  growth hormone secretory function was measured
by radioimmunoassay of plasma samples taken
before and after insulin-induced hypoglycemia in a standardized
test of growth hormone reserve.  all patients
exhibited significant defects in growth hormone secretion,
as indicated by the failure of this hormone to rise
to normal levels in response to hypoglycemia.  the order
of frequency of hormonal loss was: growth hormone,
gonadotropin, adrenocorticotropic hormone, thyroid
stimulating hormone.  no pattern of deficiency was characteristic
for any particular etiology of hypopituitarism.
one patient with asymptomatic enlargement of the sella
turcica (accidentally discovered) had an isolated loss
of growth hormone secretory capacity.  two patients in
the series demonstrated intrinsic deficiency of thyroid
as well as pituitary secretion, and both had elevated
liters of antithyroid antibodies.  this study represents
the first direct evaluation, by radioimmunoassay of
growth hormone function in a series of hypopituitary
adults.  it demonstrates a remarkably high prevalence
of growth hormone loss, and suggests that the growth
hormone response to hypoglycemia may be one of the
most sensitive tests for the diagnosis of hypopituitarism.

hypoglycemia and dwarfism associated with the isolated
deficiency of growth hormone.
the authors have studied a 7-year-old dwarfed
boy with a history of severe, recurrent
hypoglycemic episodes since age 1 and
retarded bone age.  hepatic, adrenal,
and thyroid function were normal.  he demonstrated
fasting hypoglycemia with blood
sugars of 30-40 mg./100 ml.  he was not sensitive
to l-leucine but showed insulin
sensitivity and hypoglycemic unresponsiveness.
glycogenolysis in response to both
adrenaline and glucagon was appropriate.  fasting
plasma gh levels were less than
1 m g./ml. (normal 1-3), and no rise was seen
after insulin-induced hypoglycemia.
similarly, these low gh levels did not rise 3-6
hr.  after a glucose tolerance test.
treatment with hgh reversed the alterations
in carbohydrate metabolism.  it is
concluded that the patient suffered from an isolated
gh deficiency which resulted in
dwarfism and alterations in carbohydrate metabolism.

the effect of growth hormone in hypothalamo-pituitary
dwarfism. i. the metabolic effects of human growth hormone.
human growth hormone, isolated by raben's
method, was given in 2 to 5 mg. daily
doses over periods from 1 to 12 days to 7 patients
with pituitary-hypothalamic dwarfism.
the metabolic effects were as follows:
nitrogen retention with a variable
reduction in blood urea.  the plasma amino-acid
concentration did not alter after
i.m. injection of the hormone during fasting.
an accompanying retention of intracellular
components, in such proportions required
for protoplasm formation.
isotonic expansion of the extracellular compartment,
without change in the plasma
electrolyte concentrations.  retention of phosphorus,
sometimes a rise in plasma
phosphate; increased intestinal calcium absorption,
hypercalciuria, no alteration
in plasma calcium; an increase in plasma citrate
and citrate urinary excretion;
the calcium and phosphate retention was reversed
on stopping treatment.  mobilisation
of fat stores with lipid catabolism: this
was accompanied by a well marked
increase in nefa concentration for some hours
after hormone injection in the
fasting state, after a period of hypoglycaemia
and low nefa levels.  a complex,
biphasic action on glucose metabolism.  fasting
blood sugar levels are altered,
as are the glycaemia in various tests such as
fasting, insulin injections, tolbutamide
administration, intestinal hyperglycaemia.
acceleration of intermediate
metabolism with increased blood citrate
concentrations and 24 hours urinary
excretion of  -ketoglutaric acid.  in one test
during fasting the blood citrate increased
4 hours after hormone injection.  after
an oral load of sugar the blood citrate
and  -ketoglutaric acid concentrations
did not alter.  a progressive gain in
weight has been found during treatment, partly
reversible on stopping treatment,
correlating with the intracellular nitrogen retention
and expansion of the extracellular
space, despite mobilisation of fat reserves.

serum chorionic 'growth hormone-prolactin' and serum pituitary
growth hormone in mother and fetus at term.
chorionic 'growth hormone-prolactin' (cgp) and
pituitary hgh were measured in
maternal and fetal blood obtained simultaneously
at term from 29 pregnant women
and their fetuses utilizing sensitive radioimmunoassay
procedures.  the mean concentration
of serum cgp in maternal venous blood
was 5.6  g/ml (sem0.39) whereas
in umbilical venous serum the mean concentration
was 0.019  g/ml (sem 0.003),
a 300-fold difference.  contrariwise, the mean
concentration of serum hgh in maternal
serum was 5.9 m g/ml (sem 0.52) and
in umbilical venous serum the level
was 33.5 m g/ml (sem 4.6).  the ratio of serum
cgp/hgh in maternal venous serum
was 1076 in contrast to 0.57 in umbilical venous
serum.  the findings strongly suggest
that cgp is secreted by the syncytiotrophoblast
almost exclusively in a unidirectional
manner into the maternal circulation.
further, it is unlikely that an appreciable
exchange of hgh occurs between the
maternal and fetal circulations.  the
data support the view that the growth hormone-like
metabolic changes observed in
pregnancy are attributable to the effects of cgp
and are consistent with the hypothesis
that cgp is an important metabolic hormone
of pregnancy exerting its actions
on the mother and possibly the placenta, but only
indirectly on the fetus.

effect of abdominal operation on glucose tolerance and serum levels of

   abdominal operations of moderate severity are
followed by high fasting blood-glucose levels and a reduced
tolerance to intravenous glucose which persists
for at least 72 hours after operation.  fasting plasma-insulin
levels are raised after surgery.  intravenous glucose
produces much higher levels of serum-insulin and
growth hormone in the immediate postoperative period.
corticotrophin infusion increases the plasma-hydrocortisone
levels and reduces glucose assimilation to a
greater extent than operation, but has no effect on serum-insulin
or growth-hormone levels.

plasma growth hormone concentration in the rat determined by
radioimmunoassay: influence of sex, pregnancy, lactation, anesthesia,
hypophysectomy and extrasellar pituitary transplants.
   the assay used is described in detail.  several experimental
conditions were studied, both to validate the
method and to determine factors which regulate gh secretion
in this species.  in fasting sprague-dawley rats
weighing 150-200 g, mean plasma gh concentration in
females was 94.2 17.3, and in males, 54.9 12.0 m g/ml.
gh levels in lactating rats were determined to be in
the normal range for females, thereby providing evidence
that this assay does not detect prolactin.  gh levels were
not elevated in pregnant rats.  hypophysectomy led to a
fall below detectable levels of gh.  intraocular pituitary
transplants failed to raise gh levels in hypophysectomized
hosts.  gh levels in male, but not in female, rats
are depressed by brief periods of ether anesthesia.  these
findings and the results of pituitary transplantation experiments
are further evidence that the nervous system
is involved in the regulation of gh secretion.

clinical features of the alalies (russian).
the term 'alalies' is applied to the various
states of absence or insufficient development
of speech in children, resulting
from defective development or affections
of the speech centers before the development
of speech.  from the clinical
study it is possible to distinguish between several
forms: motor, sensory, and
semantic alaly with signs of amnesia.  the
causes are multiple: trauma, perinatal
cerebral hemorrhage, inflammatory processes,
metabolic disorders before the
development of speech, and alimentary and
trophic disorders.  the alalies show
varying degrees of severity.  in most children
suffering from alaly, neurological
signs can be demonstrated on the right side,
an indication of the organic nature of
the condition.  the presence of local symptoms
in the various forms of alaly is
often associated with signs indicating involvement
of adjacent regions of the cerebral
hemispheres in the pathological process
which would explain why the alalies
are often complex.  the character of the alalies
depends on functional disorders
resulting from the lesion in the frontal, anterior,
motor, temporal or parietal

patients with alaly often show neurotic

an unusual form of acquired aphasia in children.
an unusual form of acquired aphasia-both
receptive and executive is described
as occurring in 10 children, 6 girls and 4 boys.
the onset occurred between 5 and
6 yr. of age with one or more epileptiform
attacks-which were not repeated-but
were followed by some degree of hearing
loss (later improving), failure to
comprehend spoken language and finally loss
or impairment of executive speech.
examination of csf and peg yielded normal
results.  eeg's were abnormal mainly
in the temporal leads.  the disorder appeared
self-limiting and throughout non-verbal
intelligence was not imparied.

childhood echolalia in delayed, psychotic and neuropathologic
speech patterns.
some linguistic analytical procedures and
preliminary findings from controlled tape-recorded
samples of a group of echolalic
children are reported together with the
clinical and experimental rationale for the
investigation.  the subjects are echolalic
3-yr. olds and a group of young clinical referrals
representing a variety of pathological
conditions.  variables selected for
study include the proportion of echo to
non-echo and silence, the quality and appropriateness
of the non-echoed speech, the
amount of the stimulus echoed, the nature
of the triggering stimulus, the deviation of
echo pattern from stimulus pattern, pitch-loudness-time
variations, and the child's
chronological and mental ages.  early quantitative
results yielded very similar echo:
non-echo:silence percentages with echolalia
representing a mean of about 40% of the
conversation of each experimental group.

speech as a landmark in development.
it is attempted to demonstrate how observations
of children's speech and language
development may serve as valuable indicators of
their general physical, intellectual,
and emotional progress.  speech lag or breakdown
may corroborate other suspect
areas of development or may point the way to them.
speech and language disorders
seldom originate in the mouth.  ideas must precede
speech, and speech is a direct
correlate of intelligence.
.I 888
.W
the applicability of individualized programed instruction
in the education of deaf children.
verbal behavior is learned behavior and as
such is guided by the same principles
as any other learned behavior.  the parents'
role is mainly to help the young deaf
child conceive of language as a socializing
process and to help shape language behavior
toward the use of verbal symbols.
the teacher's role in the deaf child's
progress as a language user includes (1) helping
the child discover how the structure
of his language operates and (2) guiding
him in the process of acquiring clear
concepts.  the learning of a language is a highly
individualized process and requires
thousands of hours of practice.  efficiency
in language teaching to the deaf
has not been generally achieved by traditional
methods.  the teacher of the deaf
needs extra help in order to provide the individualistic
kind of teaching to insure
verbal over-learning by the child.  self-tutoring
programed materials offer this
help.  programs are so constructed that a child
proceeds through the program step
by step with a probability of maximum success
because of constant feedback as to
correctness of his responses.  for younger
children the use of a machine seems
desirable while for older children the program
may appear in book form, on film
strip, and any other visual medium.  well constructed
programs should be correlated
with classroom instruction.

the impact of individual differences on language learning.
a matrix of extrinsic and intrinsic factors affecting
language learning in the prelingually
deaf child is considered.  particular
emphasis is placed on the effects

or restriction of experience.

the oral language performance of premature children and controls.
fifty-one premature children born in 1955
and 1956 were compared with 55 normally
born subjects with birth weights over
2,500 grams.  they were tested on
tapped patterns, auditory memory span,
auditory discrimination, word recognition,
language comprehension, articulation,
resistance to articulation disintegration,
word finding, story telling, number of words
used, mean length of 5 longest sentences,
sentence elaboration, grammatical
errors, definitions and categories.
the mean age of both groups was 5.8 and the
premature children's performance
was inferior to that of children born at term.
.I 891
.W
speech and reading problems in childhood.
the following communicative disorders
have been discussed: functional articulation
defects, delayed speech development,
stuttering, hearing loss, cleft palate,
neurological disorders, and reading disorders.
these disorders rarely have a
single cause.  they are the result of an
intermingling of many factors, some physiological
and some psychological, some
residing within the child and some in the
parents and environment in general.  delayed
or defective speech is a cause for
great concern to most parents and teachers.
the public health worker who listens
with an attentive and sympathetic ear may
allay some of this anxiety and thus help
foster healthy emotional development in
the child.  the existence of a more serious
condition underlying the presenting communication
problem, even if sensed by the
parents, is frequently denied.  the public
health worker can assist the parents in
the painful process of facing up to their
fears.  a child with a communication problem
is still a child and the public health worker
by simply reflecting this to the parents
and advising them on normal child-raising
practices can, again, be of help to the
child.  children with speech deviations are
exposed to an overabundance of well-intentioned
speech correction at home.
most of it is ineffective; some of it, unfortunately
is harmful.  while the worker
may not be in a position to offer specific
advice on a particular child, the manner
in which the parents and teacher are handling
the child's communication problem
can be explored and damaging practices
possibly eliminated.  the fact that there
may be a diagnostic and treatment center
to which the child can be referred does
not vitiate the public health worker's role.
the public health physician and public health
nurse have a valuable contribution
to make in helping the parents, school,
and child accept the chronic nature of the disorder.

acquired aphasia in children.
this report concerns the cases of 21 boys
and 11 girls studied over a period of several
years while rehabilitation was carried
out.  the general conclusions fall under
3 headings: (1) symptomatology as compared
with that of aphasia in the adult; (2) the
course of the disorder; (3) prospects of the
level of intellectual performance in the
future of the children.  in 13 cases, cerebral
damage had resulted from traumatic
contusion; in 10 cases from an intracranial
nontraumatic hematoma (vascular malformation,
aneurysm or angioma); in 2 cases
the aphasia followed operation for a
cerebral astrocytoma; in 2 further cases
occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery
had occurred; and in the remaining 5 cases
no precise diagnosis was made.
.I 894
.W
the causes of delayed development of speech.
speech develops parallelly and simultaneously
with psychophysical development of
the child, arising from internal need and
under the influence of external factors.  not
all children are given the chance to develop
in favorable conditions and to pass through
all the phases of development without some
injury.  the various possibilities when a
child may be injured and hampered in the
development of speech are discussed.  the
testing of the sense of hearing in children
with a cleft palate is also included-out of
181 cases of cleft palate, in 72 cases there
was decrease of the sense of hearing exceeding
30 db.  this additional injury of
the child with a cleft palate, if remaining unnoticed,
may make the treatment of speech
abnormality difficult.  the necessity of
diagnostic team investigation and the treatment
of children with speech disturbances
are emphasized.

concept learning in culturally disadvantaged children as
a function of verbal pretraining.
while research indicates that verbal pretraining
has a positive influence on the discrimination
learning performance of subjects
of normal intelligence, a comparable
influence has not been shown for other types
of conceptual tasks for retarded subjects.
the purpose of this experiment was
to investigate the effects of stimulus
pretraining on concept learning by subjects
who had a 'high risk' of being classified
as mentally retarded at some future time.
a group of 27 'higher risk' and 27 'lower
risk' subjects was randomly divided into
3 pretraining groups: verbal label, attention,
and control.  subsequent to pretraining on
the stimuli used for transfer task 1, subjects
in each group were presented with a
concept learning task (transfer task 1).
after reaching the criterion of learning on
transfer task 1, subjects were presented
with a second, new, concept learning task.
analysis of the data revealed that there
were no significant performance differences
between risk groups and that pretraining
had a significantly positive effect on performance.

development in children.  the contributions

formal speech characteristics as a diagnostic aid in childhood
psychosis.
the frequency of use of various grammatical
units in the spontaneous conversational
speech of adults and children has been
noted by many authors to be fairly stable.
the hypothesis that idiosyncratic distributions
might be found in certain specific
disorders of ego functioning was tested
in relationship to childhood psychosis.  some
support was found for this, as well as
for some contemporary psychological and
psychoanalytical interpretations of phenomena
seen in childhood psychosis.
.I 898
.W
cerebral dominance and speech acquistion in deaf children.
in examining the prediction that left cerebral
dominance, as indexed by hand and
sighting preference, should be a positive accompaniment
of speech learning in individuals
whose cerebral speech areas are likely
to be in the left hemisphere, it was
found that over a 10-12 year period of formal
education right-handed-right-sighting
deaf students consistently earned higher speech
grades than their right-handed-left-sighting
and right-handed-mixed-sighting counterparts
matched on the basis of
hearing loss.  this finding supports the hypothesis
that the cerebral mechanisms
relevant to speech acquisition are simplified,
facilitated, and/or less prone to
interference when control of speech, hand, and
eye is localized primarily in 1
hemisphere of the brain.

a color test for the measurement of antibody to the non-acid-forming
human mycoplasma species.
   a metabolic inhibition test
for the measurement of
growth inhibiting antibodies to
the non-acid producing
human mycoplasma species is
described.  the test is
based upon the ability of these
organisms to metabolize
arginine with a resultant alkaline
shift in the ph of the
medium.  the alkaline shift is
inhibited by specific antiserum.
labile accessory factor(s)
present in unheated
guinea pig serum potentiates
the inhibitory effect of antiserum.

and specific for the measurement
of antibody to mycoplasmas
in rabbit immune
and human convalescent serum.

serologic epidemiologic studies with m. pneumoniae. i. demonstration
of an hemagglutinin and its inhibition by antibody.
   a new direct, specific
hemagglutination reaction
with live m. pneumoniae is described.
this requires the presence of a natural antibody
for the red cell in the
horse serum employed in the
diluent.  although vervet
monkey erythrocytes generally
have been employed,
human and rabbit cells may be
used.  hemagglutination
can be inhibited by specific antibody
but heat inactivation
of the sera is required,
whether they be human or
animal in origin.  antibodies
persist for many years and
are passively transferred to
the fetus.  a micro variation
has been devised.  the test
is useful for diagnostic
and epidemiologic studies and,
in reverse, can be utilized
for the rapid serologic
identification of new isolates.
the method is limited,
at present, to m. pneumoniae.

serologic epidemiologic studies with m. pneumoniae. ii. prevalence of
antibodies in several populations.
   the prevalence of antibodies
for m. pneumoniae
was determined in 6 populations
by means of a new
serologic test.  among members
of a population of 'normal'
families, no one under
age 15 had antibodies.
none of the latter acquired an
infection during the following
year.  of 67 children in
a home, only 3 had antibodies.
the 7 cottage mates
of one of these children
who had acquired an infection,
remained uninfected.  in
a group of 124 elderly persons,
65 (53%) had antibodies.
a similar proportion of 76 persons
attending a rheumatic
fever prophylaxis clinic
was positive.  in this population
it was demonstrated that
antibodies could persist
in undiminished titer for at least
10 yr.  of 169 point
barrow residents, 68% had
antibodies.  above age 15
the rate was approximately
90%.  two companies of
naval recruits who had similar
positive antibody rates
at the beginning of training,
acquired antibodies in
rather divergent patterns, 63%
in one and 26% in the
other.  m. pneumoniae infections
seem to be sporadic
and to produce epidemics only
infrequently in civilian
populations.

growth and survival of mycoplasma neurolyticum in liquid media.
maximal growth of m. neurolyticum (between
10 and 10 colony-forming units/ml)
was obtained after 3 days of incubation
at 36 c in broth media containing 10% agama
horse serum.  when whole horse serum
was used in the medium, a complement-mediated
inhibition was observed.  this
inhibition could only be detected when growth
was followed by daily plate counts.  maximal
growth was delayed for about 24 hr by
the horse serum, and the inhibition was
spontaneously reversed at the temperature
of incubation.  penicillin g was also found
to have a temporary inhibitory effect.
this was detected with as little as 40 units/ml.
maximal growth was delayed until
the 6th day of incubation, when 200 units/ml
was present, and until the 16th day,
when 1,000 units/ml was present.  the
survival of m. neurolyticum at undetectable
levels in cultures during the incubation
period presented an 'eclipse' phenomenon
which has not been explained.  the recrudescence
of growth in such cultures late in
the incubation period illustrates the events
which may occur when mycoplasmas are
isolated from clinical material by prolonged
incubation in the presence of inhibitors
survival data showed that m. neurolyticum
had greatest stability at ph 8.0, with
reduced viability at ph 9.0, 7.0, 10.0, and
6.0, in that order.  the data on growth
and stability suggest a close relationship
between the species of mycoplasma studies
and bacteria.

hela cells resistant to bromodeoxyuridine and deficient in thymidine
kinase activity.
mutant sublines of hela s3 cells resistant
to growth inhibition by bromodeoxyuridine
(budr) have been isolated.  the resistant
cell lines (hela bu-10, hela bu-15,
hela bu-25, hela bu-50, and hela bu-100)
proliferated in the presence of 10,
15,25,50, and 100 mg/ml budr, respectively.
extracts from hela bu-25, hela
bu-50, and hela bu-100 cells exhibited
2-5% of the thymidine-h, deoxyuridine-h,
and bromodeoxyuridine-h phosphorylating
activities of parental hela s3 cells.
hela bu-10 and hela bu-15 cell extracts
were also deficient in thymidine kinase
activity, yielding approx. 43% and 8%,
respectively, the thymidine kinase activity
of parental hela s3 cells.  the deficiency
in thymidine kinase activity of hela bu-100
cells was not due to negative feedback inhibition
by high levels of budr or to interference
with the thymidine kinase assay by
inhibitors or competing enzymes in the
hela bu-100 cell extracts.  following 5 weekly
passages in media lacking budr,
the hela bu-100 cells did not exhibit increased
thymidine kinase activity.  moreover,
mixtures of extracts from hela s3
and hela bu-100 cells displayed a thymidine
kinase activity equivalent to the sum
of the activities or extracts prepared,
respectively, from the hela s3 and hela
bu-100 cells.  radioautographic studies
have shown that after hela s3 cells were
incubated for 6 hr with thymidine-h,
35-45% of the nuclei were heavily labeled
with radioactivity.  however, fewer hela
bu-100 cells displayed labeled nuclei and
the nuclei were only lightly labeled.
hela bu-100 cell extracts contained normal
amounts of thymidylate synthetase,
thymidilate kinase, and uridine kinase activities.
following infection by vaccinia
virus, high levels of thymidine kinase activity
were induced in hela bu-100 cells.

chromosome studies of human cells infected in utero and
in vitro with rubella virus.
a cytologic study of metaphase chromosomes
was undertaken to determine if damage
to the genetic apparatus of human cells may
be induced by rubella virus and whether
such damage produces the pathology seen
in newborns from mothers infected early
in pregnancy.  fibroblast cell strains were
initiated in vitro from embryonic material
obtained by therapeutic abortion of fetuses
from rubella-infected mothers.  embryonic
material from spontaneous and non-rubella
therapeutic abortions yielded similar
cell strains for infection in vitro.  the
results from both types of studies were as
follows: (a) virus shedding cell strains were
obtained from all types of organs cultivated,
which indicated wide dissemination
of virus in the fetuses from rubella-infected
mothers.  (b) chronic infection could
readily be established by in vitro infection
and no cytopathic effect was noted.
(c) although many strains continued to shed
virus throughout months of in vitro cultivation,
no changes in growth properties
occurred with the exception that infected
strains from lung tissue showed limited
growth capacities.  (d) from observations
of over 2,000 metaphases, neither obvious
chromosomal rearrangements nor non-disjunctional
changes were observed in
strains infected naturally or experimentally.
(e) among 17 rubella abortion-derived
cell strains there was a marked elevation
in frequency of chromosome breakage in
3 instances (18%, 29%, 68%,).  (f) a correlation
between virus shedding in vitro and
increased chromosome breakage was noted
although this was not complete.  (g) the
combined average frequency of chromosome
breakage in one set of 7 rubella-abortion
strains was 18%; in the other set of 9 abortus
strains, 9.8%.  (h) similarly, a slight,
but significant elevation in average chromosome
break frequency (9.8%) was obtained
in four cell strains which had been experimentally
infected in vitro with rubella virus
(uninfected cells: 5.2%).  although effects
upon the chromosomes were demonstrated,
these were restricted to slight general elevations
in frequency of breakage above
normal values.  very high increases in breaks
were sporadic.  it appears more likely
that the general fetal abnormalities associated
with rubella infection in vivo result
from possible effects of the virus upon growth
rather than from effects upon the
chromosomes.  however, the studies were
restricted to fibroblasts cultured in
vitro; and effects on other types of cells
may have greater implications for this
question.

fine structure of staphylococccal l-forms.
   l forms of staph. aureus and bacterial cells were
processed by the same technique for electron microscopy.
ultrathin sections allowed comparison of structural units
and indicated that staphylococcal l form units of all
sizes lack the rigid cell wall and the compact, fibrillar
nuclear area of bacterial cells.  the l form units are
bound by a typical 'trilamellar' membrane comparable
to that described for mycoplasma species.  nuclear
areas in staphylococcal l forms present a diffuse appearance
and could not be correlated with size of any
particular structural unit.  many small units were seen
within large bodies and possibly are involved in the reproductive
process.  no evidence of division by formation
of septa or by pinching off of cytoplasmic fragments
was obtained from the electron micrographs.

respiratory virus vaccines. ii. mycoplasma pneumoniae (eaton agent)
vaccines.
   purified and concentrated formalin-killed vaccines
were prepared from m. pneumoniae propagated in
serum-free artificial medium.  the vaccines were
aqueous or were incorporated in alum or emulsified
peanut oil (adjuvant 65) adjuvant.  two or 3 different
concentrations of mycoplasma were included in each
preparation.  serum neutralizing and cf antibody responses
were measured in hamsters, monkeys, and in
institutionalized persons following 1,2,3 and sometimes
4 vaccinations.  all of the preparations were
highly antigenic in animals and in man.  alum vaccines
were better than aqueous vaccines and those in adjuvant
65 appeared to give best results although the bleeding
times were not always optimal for demonstrating
maximal effect.  persons who were without detectable
antibody initially and thus would be most vulnerable to
infection gave better responses to the vaccine than did
those with pre-existing antibody.  alum vaccine is an
acceptable formulation for use in man, and only 2 doses
of such vaccine were necessary to induce neutralizing
antibody in 90% of the persons who were initially without
detectable antibody.  no local or systemic reaction
of clinical consequence was noted in any of the persons
vaccinated.  recent unpublished findings, which indicate
a high degree of effectiveness of the alum vaccine
in stimulating antibody in preschool children and in
protecting children and adults against the natural disease,
are mentioned.

isolation of mycoplasma pneumoniae from adults with respiratory
infections.
isolation of mycoplasma organisms from the sputum
was attempted in 254 patients with various syndrome
of respiratory disease.  isolates were obtained in 56% of
the 197 patients with pneumonia, 50% of patients with
chronic bronchial diseases who were not treated with
tetracycline, and 33% of persons with acute upper respiratory
infection.  these differences are not statistically
significant and indicate a nonpathogenic role for m.
pharyngis and m. salivarium which were the strains most
frequently isolated.  the highest frequency of isolation
was from males 15 to 30 yr. of age.  isolation of m.
pneumoniae requires one to 2 weeks:therefore, it is not
useful for rapid diagnosis.  also, it underestimates the
prevalence of infection, especially if patients have received
tetracycline.  of the serologic tests, complement-fixation
(cf) was the most specific.  the growth
inhibition test (tri) was the most sensitive and was
significantly related to atypical pneumonia.  the 2 tests
may measure different antibodies against m. pneumoniae.
serum cold agglutinins developed in many cases
of pneumonia and were poorly discriminatory in etiologic
diagnosis.  m. pneumoniae infection occurred in a
minimum of 8% and a maximum of 20% of civilian patients
hospitalized for pneumonia during the season studied.
serologic evidence for m. pneumoniae was rare in
lobar pneumonia.  in nonlobar pneumonia, m. pneumoniae
accounted etiologically for 13% to 50% of cases.  the incidence
of m. pneumoniae infection was constant in
different seasons but greatest relative to the occurrence
of pneumonia in the fall and spring.

color test for the measurement of antibody to t-strain mycoplasmas.
   a metabolic inhibition technique for the measurement
of antibody to t-strain mycoplasmas was developed,
based upon the ability of t-strain mycoplasmas to
metabolize urea with the concomitant production of ammonia,
and the ability of specific, antiserum to inhibit
this ammonia production.  phenol red added to the
medium served as an indicator of ph change resulting
from ammonia production.  specific antiserum to t-strain
mycoplasma t-960 was prepared.  the t-strain
organism was shown to be serologically distinct from the
recognized large-colony mycoplasmas.  antibody to
mycoplasma strain t-960 in human sera was demonstrated
with the metabolic inhibition technique.

1, the negroni agent, and the f12 mycoplasma were
used for infection of l cells, and m. hominis 1 and m.
pneumoniae for inoculation of hek cells.  all strains
were capable of multiplication in the culture systems
employed.  none produced detectable levels of interferon,
and responsiveness of the cells to induction of interferon
by virus remained unaltered.  infection with mycoplasma
did not impair the sensitivity of the cells to the action of
interferon, nor was the replication of vesicular stomatitis
virus noticeably diminished.

electron microscopic studies of mycoplasma (pplo strain 880) in
artificial medium and in tissue culture.
mycoplasma strain 880, isolated from a leukemic
patient, was studied in broth
cultures and in several cell culture lines.
this strain exhibited considerable pleomorphism
in size, internal structure, and
shape, including forms with filamentous
projections.  the most common form observed
was 0.5 to 1 in diameter and
had a nuclear area of fibrillar strands, probably
dna.  the cytoplasm of the organisms
contained ribosome-like granules and
a flattened vacuole which indented the
nuclear area.  there were various other forms,
including 'elementary bodies' 100m
in diameter that were very electron-dense.
in the tissue culture lines in which
the cells grew as a monolayer, the mycoplasma
were closely associated with the
cell surface and were occasionally seen in
membrane-lined cytoplasmic vacuoles.
in cell lines that did not attach to the glass,
the mycoplasma were fewer and not
attached to the cell surface.  although the
ultrastructure of this strain is similar
to that of previously described strains, there
are differences in details of structure
which may be related either to the growth
conditions used or to characteristics of
the strain.  the various forms of the organism
are consistent with the suggestion
that mycoplasma may have several mechanisms
of reproduction (growth).  the intracellular
mycoplasma may be protected from
antibiotics.  this would partly explain
the difficulty of eradicating mycoplasma from
infected cell cultures.

long-term prognosis and the response of schizophrenic children
to drug therapy: a controlled study of trifluoperazine.
   it is evident from this study that treatment and
control groups must be matched for severity of illness,
since this affects the responsiveness to pharmacological
as well as to other types of treatments.  the use of
the double-blind technique does not of itself guarantee
a well-controlled study; the comparison of 2 or more
treatment regimes may be misleading if the groups are
not matched, or if the matching is not based on critical
factors.  in this study, both the response to the nonpharmacologic
aspects of treatment and the type of
response to the drug itself were related to the initial
severity of language impairment.  thus the major developmental
defect which determines long-term outcome
for schizophrenic children in this group also predicted
the immediate responsiveness to treatment.  within the
2 major prognostic subgroups of young schizophrenic
children, those with speech and those without, are children
with different profiles of disordered development
and different patterns of assets and handicaps.

   description of one phase of the long term psychotherapy

disturbed children.  underlining the well-known
importance of the therapeutic milieu in the treatment
and care of the mentally ill particularly important when
the patients are children.  the child presented was diagnosed,
when admitted, as a case of severe childhood
psychosis, of the autistic type.  the unusually rich data
at disposal were obtained through non-verbal communication,
because the child has no language.  nevertheless,
he can express himself clearly through play and gestures.
the analysis of this precious clinical material focuses

into several subgroups (as, for instance,
the subgroup of kanner and the subgroup
of asperger) and has been assigned to
different mental conditions (schizophrenia,
psychopathy, neurosis).  these distinctions
and classifications are thought to be
controversial, so long as the etiology of
early infantile autism is unknown.  nor
should any 'psychiatric school' claim to
have the 'right' concept of schizophrenia,
since the etiology of schizophrenia, too,
has not yet been discovered.  in this particular
'pre-scientific' situation of psychiatry
it seems more promising to analyze
the individual mental case and to concentrate
on clinical symptomatology instead
of discussing arbitrary 'nosological entities'.

families of children with early childhood schizophrenia.
emotionally disturbed children were divided
into 3 groups on the basis of their
diagnoses of: (1) autism or symbiosis,
(2) chronic undifferentiated schizophrenia,
and (3) other forms of emotional disturbance.
the 3 groups were compared statistically
on the following demographic measures:
(1) educational level of parents; (2)
occupational level of father; (3) prevalence
of broken homes; (4) male-female ratio
in each patient group; (5) ordinal position
among siblings; (6) ordinal position
among siblings of same sex; and (7) age of
parents at birth of child.  results indicated
that families of children diagnosed
as autistic or symbiotic show many
similarities to those with the diagnosis of
chronic undifferentiated schizophrenia.
in general, the parents in these 2 groups
were better educated and were employed
in more highly rated occupations than parents
of otherwise disturbed subjects.
broken homes were prevalent in the group
of disturbed nonschizophrenic children,
but not in the autistic or chronic undifferentiated
schizophrenic groups.  the male-female
ratio was not significantly different
among the 3 groups; in the autistic
group, specifically, it was 2.8:1.  the data
revealed no trend in ordinal position.

childhood psychosis.
a description is given of the diagnostic criteria
put forward by creak and her associates
in 1961 for what they have called
'schizophrenic syndrome of childhood'.
psychotic reactions in childhood are grouped
into: (1) childhood schizophrenia, (2)
organic states with psychosis, (3) mental
subnormality with psychosis, (4) sensory
deprivation, (5) neurosis, and (6) manic-depressive
psychosis.  it is suggested that
the generic term 'psychosis' is the best
available, and a classification is presented
and discussed.

psychotic reactions of childhood: experiences of a mental retardation
pilot project.
   clinical team evaluations are presented of a group
of 32 psychotic children who were initially thought to be
mentally retarded.  emphasis is placed on consideration
of as many aspects of the total picture as possible with
diagnosis resulting from a synthesis of the individual
pieces of information.  caution is suggested regarding
interpretation of incomplete psychological test findings,
especially in regard to prognosis.  the results of this
study offer guidelines for differential diagnosis between
psychosis resulting from primary emotional disorders
and psychosis superimposed on a chronic brain syndrome
in children.  questions are raised about early infantile
autism as a unitary syndrome on the basis of etiology.
the need for a better and more comprehensive diagnostic
classification of the psychotic reactions of infancy and
early childhood is stressed.  this must be developed
before valid comparisons of treatment and prognostic
considerations can be made among groups of clinicians
working in the field.

modification of autistic behavior with lsd-25.
   lsd-25 appears to offer a useful adjunct to the
psychotherapy of autistic children because of its positive
effect in areas which are closely related to the process
of psychotherapy.  a pair of identical male autistic twins
was periodically administered 50 of lsd-25 and
observed for behavior changes.  control and drug observations
were made while the subjects were placed in a series
of standard test situations referred to as the socialization
test, social isolation test, peek-a-boo, pat-a-cake,
face-to-face, hand-holding and following tests.
diverse behaviors were recorded in the areas of self-stimulatory
behavior, social interaction and affect.
recordings were made using an esterline angus multiple
pen recorder.  all behaviors were measured in total time
appearance and plotted as percent time in appearance.
consistent behavioral changes resulted after lsd in that
the subjects demonstrated an increase in eye-to-face
contact, an increase in laughter and smiling behavior
and decrease in self-stimulatory behavior.
.I 922
.W
the influence of organic and emotional factors on the origins, nature
and outcome of childhood psychosis.
a group of 65 children diagnosed as 'child
psychosis' (or one of its synonyms)
was followed up for an average of 15 yr.
none of the parents were schizophrenic;
6 (10%) had a parent who had psychiatric
treatment for neurosis.  only 2 children
had a sib with transient autistic episode.
none had sibs with the adult type of
schizophrenia.  these findings are felt to
militate against the view that child
psychosis is part of the schizophrenic group.
among the 65 children: 40% had an
i.q. below 50, 40% between 50 and 80 and
only 20% above 80.  the i.q. was found
in general to be a good predictor of later
performances.  mental retardation is
regarded as a primary component of the
clinical picture.  evidence of brain damage
was conclusive in 15 children (24%) who showed
epileptic attacks (developing in 10
of them during the follow-up).  speech disorders
were the most outstanding manifestation.
five children had confirmed receptive
aphasia and 14 others show some
evidence of it.  in 75% of the speaking children
echolalia was noted; 11% had abnormalities
of delivering spoken words.  the
view that reduction of speech is due
to social withdrawal is rejected.  psychogenic
factors and parental attitude were
not found to be relevant to the etiology.  the
psychosis is not considered primarily
emotional in origin, although emotional
relationships as well as educational management
have considerable influence on the
outcome of the disease.
.I 923
.W
compliance and resistance in the conditioning of autistic children:
an exploratory study.
twelve autistic children between 4 and 9 yr
of age were asked to choose red objects
and square objects from a stimulus array.
ten subjects made correct choices
significantly less often than chance, that is,
they avoided emitting correct responses.
the subjects were given 60 conditioning
trials in which choices of either red or
square objects were reinforced.  those who
attained either concept subsequently
performed perfectly when asked to produce
both red and square concepts; the other
subjects continued giving fewer-than-chance
correct responses.  thus, conditioning
trials elicited in some subjects an increased
tendency to comply with the experimenter's
instructions.  the results suggest
that more attention should be paid to
the distinction between responses that
autistic children are unable to make and
responses that they are unwilling to make.
.I 924
.W
the etiology of autistic syndromes of children.
examination and treatment of 92 children
and youths with the autistic syndromes
of early childhood over a period of ten years
led to the impression that these
disorders are a primary organic syndrome
of manifold etiology.  this view is
supported by many relevant clinical
experiences and data, which are discussed
in detail.
.I 925
.W
acquisition of imitative speech by schizophrenic children.
two mute schizophrenic children were taught
imitative speech within an operant
conditioning framework.  the training
procedure consisted of a series of increasingly
fine verbal discriminations; the children
were rewarded for closer and closer
reproductions of the attending adults' speech.
it is found that reward delivered
contingent upon imitation was necessary for
development of imitation.  furthermore,
the newly established imitation was shown
to have acquired rewarding properties
for the children.
.I 926
.W
hallucinations in children at a state hospital.
   hallucinations in children at referral and upon admission
to a state hospital were studied by reviewing
randomly selected charts of current patients.  there
were no significant differences in the incidence of
hallucinations in boys and girls, between racial groups,
and between schizophrenic children under 12 and over
12.  the children diagnosed psychosis with convulsive
disorder had the highest incidence of hallucinations
(81%); those diagnosed childhood schizophrenia had an
incidence of 70%; and children diagnosed primary behavior
disorder had the lowest incidence (35%).  specific
auditory, visual, and olfactory hallucinations were described.
the nature of hallucinations in boys and girls
was similar.  psychotic children tended to have more
bizarre hallucinations than nonpsychotic children.  there
was no difference in the nature of hallucinations among
the different groups of psychotic children.  although this
population consisted of severely disturbed and deprived
children who had a high incidence of hallucinations,
these hallucinations were of simple content and not
organized into delusional systems.
.I 927
.W
treatment of childhood schizophrenia.  a three-year comparison of day
and residential treatment.
   a carefully designed study of 13 day-treatment
children matched individually with 13 residential children
is presented.  in each case the diagnosis of schizophrenia
was carefully confirmed on the basis of impairment
in human relationship, disturbance in personal
identity, resistance to change, unusual preoccupations,
perceptual and cognitive disorders, and panic reactions.
the ages ranged between 6 and 11.  the children were
selected, as the result of matching, with regard to age
of onset, culture, and family organization.  intactness
of the family structure was required.  residential treatment
implied round-the-clock therapeutic interaction
with the child for 7 days each week, 12 mth of the year.
day treatment consisted of 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. care
5 days a week for 9 mth of the year.  staff distribution
was identical in the 2 groups, but in the day-care group
the teacher assumed a larger relative position in the
world established for the child.  all children were matched
in ego status at the beginning of the experiment
by means of the wisc and psychiatric evaluation,
changes in this status being measured by the wisc and
the metropolitan achievement test series.  the results
indicated no significant improvement in either day or
residence in those schizophrenic children who, on admission
had unscorable wisc tests and who were the
most severely impaired in ego structure.  among the
children scorable on the wisc, the organic groups in
day and in residential treatment showed equivalent degrees
of progress, the non-organic children in residence
gave evidence of more improvement than did the
matched children in day treatment.

.W
visual versus tactual receptor preference in normal and schizophrenic
children.
   receptor preferences between visual or tactual
stimuli were measured in schizophrenic and normal
children; 4 pairs of standardized choice situations between
visual or tactual stimuli were used, with the time
of engagement with either stimulus constituting the
preference measure.  schizophrenic children between the
ages of 7 and 9 were compared with same aged normal
children.  a group of retardates were used for ma control.
schizophrenics were significantly lower in visual
preference than the same aged normals, and an age trend
for increased visual preference was found in the normal
sample.  retardates showed greater visual preference
than schizophrenics of comparable ma.  some implications
for theory of schizophrenia were discussed.
.I 929
.W
the effect of folic acid on growth and deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis
in the rat kidney.
   the effect of a single injection of folic acid (250
mg/kg of body wt) on growth of the rat kidney was studied.
the patterns of the response were found to be essentially
similar in animals aged between 3 wk and 12 mth.
maximum values of kidney weight and nucleic acid content,
relative to body weight, were found at 4 days at
folate administration.  the increases in wet and dry
weights at this time were approx. 80% and 30% resp.
above the control weights, and the percentage dry matter
of the kidney was significantly lower than normal during
this period.  at 4 days the rna content of the kidney was
also maximal, being about 90% greater than the control
value, and the dna content after 4 days was increased
by about 60%.  whereas the dna values in 6-wk-old rats
were slightly lower at 7 and 10 days than at 4 days, in
12-mth-old animals a further small increase was observed
at 7 days, suggesting a prolongation of dna synthesis
in the older animals.  autoradiographic studies of
dna synthesis with thymidine-h have shown a greatly
increased labeling index in all zones of the kidney following
folate injection.  maximum values were observed
at 48 hr in the cortical zone, but the patterns of the
changes in the medulla were less well defined.  the labelling
indices in the kidneys of 12-mth-old rats remained
above normal for a longer period than in 6-wk-old rats.
these results concur with the evidence of an increased
dna contents of the kidneys of older rats between 4 and
7 days after folate.

.W
renal renin in unilaterally nephrectomized hypertensive rats.
juxtaglomerular index, renal pressor
activity and width of the zona glomerulosa
were normal in unilaterally nephrectomized
hypertensive rats maintained on a normal
sodium intake, increased in those
subjected to sodium depletion and decreased
in those receiving 1% saline.  this indicates
that renin formation and secretion are
most likely the result of the sodium state
of the animal rather than loss of a renin-stimulating
agent in the contralateral or
unclipped kidney.  failure of sodium to influence
the degree of hypertension in
unilaterally nephrectomized hypertensive rats
militates against a direct quantitative
relationship between blood pressure and the
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.
.I 931
.W
hypertensive vascular disease produced by homologous renin.
administration of rat renin to uninephrectomized
rats reproduced most, if not all,
the changes (hypertension, vascular disease,
hypertrophy of the zona glomerulosa
of the adrenals) found after partial constriction
of the renal artery.  this is taken
as evidence that the renal pressor system
plays a major role in the pathogenesis
of renal hypertension.
.I 932
.W
effects of hypophysectomy and growth hormone on renal compensatory
hypertrophy in rats.
   the effect of hypophysectomy on renal compensatory
hypertrophy (rch) was observed in unilaterally
nephrectomized rats receiving no therapy and those
receiving replacement therapy and was compared to the
rch attained by non-hypophysectomized unilaterally
nephrectomized rats at 2, 5, and 10 days.  in the latter
group there was an initial rapid rch seen at day 2
which continued, but at a slower rate, through day 10.
in the hypophysectomized group without replacement
therapy there was also an initial rch in the first 48 hrs.
however, instead of the rch continuing there was a
regression in kidney size at 5 days and with no subsequent
change at 10 days.  in the hypophysectomized group
receiving hormone replacement there was an initial
rch comparable to the other 2 groups, but the further
renal enlargement at 10 days was much less than that
of the non-hypophysectomized animals.  the results of
this experiment and of other reported studies imply
existence of a renotropic factor which is not produced
in the pituitary, but which requires an intact pituitary
for full effectiveness.
.I 933
.W
extrarenal fibromuscular hyperplasia.
   clinical, radiologic, and pathologic studies on
19 patients with lesions in the extrarenal arteries that
resembled fibromuscular hyperplasia are described.
in 11 patients fibromuscular hyperplasia was present
in the renal arteries.  patients with involvement of the
celiac artery were the only ones who had symptoms of
visceral ischemia.  fibromuscular hyperplasia of the
internal carotid arteries was observed in 6 patients, 2
of whom had symptoms of cerebral ischemia.  nine patients
with fibromuscular hyperplasia of the carotid or
renal arteries had intracranial aneurysms, and in 2
others intracranial hemorrhage developed in the absence
of demonstrable aneurysms.  the histologic similarities
between intracranial aneurysms and other
types of aneurysms that appear in patients with fibromuscular
hyperplasia, the frequency of intracranial
aneurysms in patients with extracranial fibromuscular
hyperplasia, and the similar sex and age incidence suggest
a common etiologic origin.

some speculations on the nature and significance of developmentally
small kidneys (renal hypoplasia).
renal hypoplasia may take several forms.
among these the best known is perhaps
renal dysplasia in which the parenchyma
is maldeveloped.  other forms of hypoplasia
in which the renal parenchyma is normally
formed but merely diminished in amount,
do exist and may have severe clinical
consequences.  the finding at postmortem
examination of anatomically small kidneys
in children who suffered excessive or
unexplained dehydration has prompted the
thought that renal tubular insufficiency may
result from renal hypoplasia.
.I 935
.W
a study of induced renal hyperplasia using autoradiography.
to establish a base line for future
autoradiographic investigations, compensatory
renal hyperplasia was studied using tritiated
thymidine.  labelled cells were infrequent
in the tubular tissues of control kidneys.
in the kidneys remaining after unilateral
nephrectomy there was a 5- to 6-fold
increase in the cortex and a 12- to 13-fold
increase in the medulla of labelled tubular
cells over the numbers seen in control
tissues.  the findings obtained here are in
agreement with the observations made in
earlier investigations with routine methods
of staining and mitotic observation.
.I 936
.W
compensatory structural and functional changes in the kidney.
the radiographic assessment of the renal
size and the factors influencing renal
hypertrophy are discussed.  the importance
of compensatory hypertrophy and its
prognostic significance is emphasised.
the changes are correlated with renal function
as measured by the glomerular filtration
rate and renal plasma flow.
.I 937
.W
bilateral renal hypoplasia of the pig.
bilateral renal hypoplasia of the pig is described
and is compared with a previous
description.  the defect was observed in 19
piglets out of a total of 73 born in 8
litters, sired by one large white boar.
twelve affected piglets died at or soon
after birth and 7 died between the ages of 11
and 69 days.  inheritance by a simple
autosomal recessive factor is suggested by
the evidence.  grossly the condition
was characterized by varying degrees of
hypoplasia and persistence of fetal lobulation.
microscopically, the dominant feature
was the poor development of the collecting
tubule system.  it is concluded that
the basic defect is a failure of development
of mesonephric mesenchyme.
.I 938
.W
the effect of nortestosterone phenylpropionate on compensatory
hypertrophy of the remaining kidney after unilateral nephrectomy.
forty-eight hr. after unilateral nephrectomy,
both in non-castrated and in castrated
male mice the relative dry weight of the
remaining kidney increased significantly.
this compensatory hypertrophy was significantly
stimulated as early as 96 hr. after
operation by treatment with 19-nortestosterone
phenylpropionate (= npp) at the
time of operation.  the percentual increase
of the kidney weight was approximately
the same in non-castrated as in castrated
mice.  the absolute initial values as well
as the resulting values 96 hr. after operation
were higher in non-castrated male
mice than in castrated animals.  the number
of cells and the dna concentration per
g. tissue decreased during the period of
non-stimulated compensatory hypertrophy
in both groups of animals.  npp caused a still
further decrease.  the concentration
of dna per cell did not change.  following
non-stimulated compensatory hypertrophy,
there was no change in the rna concentration
per g. tissue or per cell in castrated
mice.  in non-castrated mice the concentration
increased.  npp caused approximately
the same percentual increase of rna
concentration in non-castrated as in
castrated animals during the period of compensatory
hypertrophy.  the difference between
both groups of mice in the rna
concentration in the remaining kidney
following stimulation of the compensatory
hypertrophy by npp was statistically significant.
.I 939
.W
thyroid and pituitary gland activity during compensatory renal
hypertrophy.
autoradiographic studies with tritiated
thymidine showed an increased synthesis of
dna and cellular proliferation of the
thyroid and pituitary during compensatory
renal hypertrophy.
.I 940
.W
the influence of thyroid hormone on renal function during the course
of compensatory hypertrophy.
during the course of compensatory hypertrophy
of the kidney, glomerular filtration
and renal plasma flow increased to a less
extent in thyroidectomized animals than
in control animals.  the secretory capacity
of the renal tubules of thyroidectomized
animals increased insignificantly during
compensatory hypertrophy, but increased
markedly after administration of thyroid hormone.
.I 941
.W
kidney cell proliferation after unilateral nephrectomy as related
to age.
   the effect of unilateral nephrectomy on the
number of cortical kidney cells undergoing dna
synthesis and mitosis was measured by tritiated
thymidine autoradiography in both weanling and
adult rats.  among the unoperated control animals,
the weanling rat group showed a base line labeling
index of 0.59%, and the adult animals, one of 0.11%.
the response to unilateral nephrectomy resulted
in a peak value of 3.6% in the weanling animals and
1.2% in the adult animals, both occurring at 36 hr.
mitotic indices were 0.056% in the weanling control
animals and 0.0062% in the adults, with a peak
of 0.30% and 0.088%, resp., at 36 hr. separate
counts of tubule and stromal cells in the cortex
revealed that the maximum increase in % labeled cells
occurred later in the stromal cells than in the
tubule cells; the stromal cells not reaching a
maximum until 57 hr after nephrectomy.  the findings
indicate that, although the relative proliferative
activity is much lower in adult animals, a similar
response, qualitatively, is obtained in both groups
after unilateral nephrectomy.
.I 942
.W
influence of the adrenal glands on dna synthesis in normal
and compensating kidneys.
the role of the adrenal glands in controlling
the synthesis of dna in normal and
compensating kidneys of rats given saline
drinking fluid was studied using tritiated-thymidine
and radioautography.  adrenalectomy
alone increased significantly the
labeling of the renal cortex and medulla of
otherwise intact rats.  two days following
unilateral nephrectomy of rats with intact
adrenal glands, the number of labeled
nuclei in the remaining kidney increased by
factors of about 4 and 2.5 in the cortex
and the medulla, respectively.  adrenalectomy
moderately decreased the hyper-plastic
response of the cortex of the remaining
kidney, but increased still further
the labeling index of the medulla.  by 5 days
after unilateral nephrectomy of rats
with intact adrenal glands, neither the cortex
nor the medulla of the remaining kidney
exhibited a marked hyperplastic response.
in adrenalectomized animals, also,
unilateral nephrectomy caused only slight
increases in the labeling indices of the
cortex and the medulla of the remaining kidney.
.I 943
.W
auto-radiographic studies of the protein metabolism of the single
kidney in the nephrectomized rat.
rats were subjected to unilateral nephrectomy,
following which the protein metabolism
of the other kidney, which exerted
a compensatory activity, was studied
with h-labelled l-phenylalanine, at different
intervals (3hr. to 7 wk.).  two
phases of enhanced incorporation of amino-acids
into the cells of the convoluted
tubules were found, with one maximum
after 6 hr., at which time the uptake is
limited to the cytoplasm, and a 2nd maximum
on the 4th day, when the nucleus is
equally involved.  in the course of the 2nd
phase of enhanced amino-acid uptake,
there is also an increased mitotic index
of the epithelia of the tubules.  in the
collecting tubules, there was only one phase
of enhanced amino-acid uptake, with a
maximum on the 4th day, also coinciding
with an increased mitotic index.  the
increase of the number of cells of the kidney
was determined by a study of the variations
of the mitotic index.  the mean
multiplication factor in the beginning amounts
to 1.6.  the protein metabolism is increased
1.3 times.  the increase of the volume
(factor 1.3) and the increase of the protein
metabolism per unit of volume (factor 1.3)
of the hypertrophic kidney result in a
total increase of the protein metabolism
of 2.1 times, once the adaptation process
is complete, so that the residual kidney
has approximately the same protein
metabolism as 2 normal kidneys.

two brothers with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.
the patients, a 5-year-old and a 13-year-old
boy, had suffered from polydypsia
and polyuria since the age of 1 yr.  physical
and mental retardation, hyperchloremia,
and lowering of kidney concentrating power
were observed.  the patients were resistant
to pitressin.  they were considered
to be suffering from nephrogenic diabetes

studies on the sweat in renal diabetes insipidus during
treatment with saluretics.
description of a 5-month-old boy suffering
from familial diabetes insipidus.  his
sweat as well as that of his mother had an
increased nacl content.  chlorthalidone
and fursemide had a different effect both
on the quantity and on the nacl content of
the sweat.  a single dose of chlorthalidone
decreased the nacl content for a short
time, but increased the quantity of sweat
during 3 days.  fursemide given intermittently
produced a decrease of the sweat nacl
also during the intervals and an increase
of the quantity of sweat; however, as a
contraregulation during the intervals, the
quantity of sweat decreased and at the same
time the urea content increased.  from
the isotonic serum filtrate in the sweat
glands ho and nacl were reabsorbed in
the ducts and the urea concentration
increased but the reabsorption of ho and nacl
did not go parallel, therefore the sweat is
hypotonic.  this regulation is altered in
diabetes insipidus, therefore the high values
of nacl.  without changing the osmolarity,
na is exchanged with k.  this mechanism
is accentuated if the na-concentration
is high.

diabetes insipidus treated with synthetic lysine vasopressin.
a case of diabetes insipidus was associated
with an eosinophilic granuloma in a
2.5-year-old child.  partial control of symptoms
was achieved with pitressin tannate in
oil, 7.5 u. i.m. on alternate days.  synthetic
lysine vasopressin i.m. controlled
the urine output at a dose of 5 u. 8-hourly,
but the preparation was not well tolerated.
it was therefore given by the nasal route,
and over a 6-month period the diabetes
was controlled with a dose of 14 u. t.d.s.
.I 947
.W
the action of vasopressin in renal diabetes insipidus.
as the water-retaining action of antidiuretic
hormone is eliminated in renal diabetes
insipidus, the steps in na transport can
be separately determined.  vasopressin
induced a prompt increase in freewater
clearance and urinary volume, as well
as a delayed increase in sodium clearance.
it is suggested that vasopressin brings
about stimulation of sodium reabsorption in
the ascending limb of henle's loop.  it
is supposed that both physiological actions
of antidiuretic hormone - the antidiuretic
and the sodium-active effect - become operative
in two different places in the nephron
and synergistically produce a maximum
concentration of urine.

pituitary diabetes insipidus associated with progressive urinary
tract dilatation.
a case of pituitary diabetes insipidus with
associated obstructive urinary tract
changes is described.  the patient was treated
both by surgical correction of lower
tract obstruction as well as by control of
the diabetes.  reversal of anatomic changes
over a 1-year followup period is demonstrated.
.I 949
.W
the antidiuretic effect of angiotensin in diabetes insipidus.
   the effect of angiotensin (val-5-hypertensinii-asp- -amide)
was studied in 2 children with diabetes
insipidus (a 9 yr old boy with diabetes insipidus neuro-hormonalis
and a 4 yr old girl with diabetes insipidus
renalis) in whom the clearances of inulin, pah, na and
urea and the osmolar and free-water clearances were
examined.  angiotensin produces a prompt antidiuresis
which is combined with a gross decrease of the na-clearance.
the osmolality of the urine is increased only slightly
and the free-water clearance does not become negative,
both effects being contrary to those seen with vasopressin.
the antidiuresis and antinatriuresis can be produced
in salt-loaded and salt-deprived states.  furosemide
reverses the effects of angiotensin.  the clearance of
urea is not changed by angiotensin as long as the glomerular
filtration rate remains normal.

polyuria in children.
   twelve polyuric children have been investigated in
the present report from their etiologico-clinical aspect
and they have been classified into four broad groups.  the
first group of diabetes insipidus syndrome included 4
cases - 3 of idiopathic type and one of the acquired variety
due to hand-schuller-christian-disease.  the 4 cases
in the second group of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
after further investigations were diagnosed as renal
acidosis (1 case), other renal tubular syndromes with
multiple defects (2 cases), and hypokalaemic nephropathy
(1 case).  the third group of polyuria due to chronic renal
failure has been exemplified by one case.  the fourth
group of 3 cases had compulsive water drinking as the
probable etiology.  in addition to the illustrative case
histories, a practical diagnostic approach in the context
of physiopathology of normal urine excretion has been recommended.

treatment of diabetes insipidus: synthetic lysine vasopressin
nasal solution.
twenty patients with vasopressin-deficient
diabetes insipidus were treated with a
nasal solution of synthetic lysine vasopressin.
use of the nasal spray 2 to 8 times
daily controlled polyuria in all patients
without recurrence of the side effects
occasionally observed with posterior pituitary
preparations of animal origin.  one
pregnant patient was well controlled to term
without undesirable uterine stimulation.
because of its ease of administration,
the absence of significant water
retention (if used judiciously) and the freedom
from potentially serious allergic
reactions to foreign protein, this synthetic
preparation is recommended for clinical use.

synthetic lysine vasopressin nasal spray in the treatment
of diabetes insipidus.
thirteen patients with diabetes insipidus
were satisfactorily and conveniently
treated with synthetic lysine vasopressin
nasal spray, the material being administered
3 to 5 times per day in a total daily
dosage ranging from 35 to 125 u.  a
transient decrease in effectiveness was noted
during periods of upper respiratory
infection or allergic rhinitis.  the only adverse
effects of the nasal spray consisted
of minor nasal irritation in 3 patients and
increased frequency of bowel movements
in one child after he increased the dose in
an effort to concentrate and restrict
urine volume.  in hydrated normal subjects,
lysine vasopressin administered s.c.
is 7.4 times as effective as the nasal spray preparation.

diabetes insipidus treatment with 8-lysine vasopressin in a nasal spray.
synthetic 8-lysine vasopressin administered
as a nasal spray to 3 patients with diabetes
insipidus resulted in excellent control
in one.  in the other 2 it was of some
value as therapy supplemental to pitressin
tannate in oil.  the patient who was
adequately controlled with 'spray therapy' alone
required the sprays every 3 hr. during
the day, but none during the night.

salt and water distribution in hereditary and in induced hypothalamic
diabetes insipidus in the rat.
salt and water metabolism and the distribution
of na, k, and water in gastrocnemius
and in aorta were measured in spontaneous
hereditary hypothalamic and in surgically
induced diabetes insipidus in the rat.
the degree of severity in the 2 types of the
disease was estimated in terms of salt
and water handling.  water turnover in 24 hr.
was about equal to body weight in the
hereditary disease and about 60% of body weight
in the induced disease.  skeletal muscle
na increased more than 20% in the familial
disease, and the gain involved both cells
and environment.  there was no corresponding
loss of k.  similar changes of
lesser degree were noted in the induced
disease.  the degree of na accumulation
appears to be partially dependent on the
duration of the disease.

antidiuresis induced by saluretics in diabetes insipidus.
in hypothalamus-pituitary and less regularly
in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus some
diuretics cause a fall in diuresis mainly
due to reduced excretion of free water.
this adh-like action, not correlated with
the extent of the natriuretic action or with
salt depletion, depends on a direct effect
of the drug on water permeability in the
distal tubule and is suppressed by cortisone.
it is maximal for the thiazide
derivatives and diminishes progressively
with mercurial compounds, spirolactones
and triamterene in that order and is absent
for acetazolamide.  the reduction in
glomerular filtration and increased proximal
reabsorption of na following salt
depletion induced by the diuretics is of less
importance and irregular in appearance.

congenital hydronephrosis.
histological study of the renal parenchyma
in cases of hydronephrosis is a guide for
surgical treatment.  if the renal parenchyma
is reduced in thickness to 3 mm. or less
it leads to complete atrophy.  but if the
thickness is more than 3 mm. conservative
procedures are justified.

neurohypophysial principles in rats with familial hypothalamic
diabetes insipidus (brattleboro strain).
antidiuretic and oxytocic assays were
performed on tissues from 3 female rats with
familial hypothalamic diabetes insipidus (di)
and on 3 normal females.  oxytocic
activity was only slightly lower in the pituitaries
from the di rats.  antidiuretic activity
in the pituitaries from 2 di rats was
no more than that expected from their
content of oxytocin.  thus, these pituitaries
appeared to contain oxytocin but not
arginine vasopressin.  the hypothalami from
these 2 rats showed minimal antidiuretic
activity, which might have been due to
oxytocin or vasopressin.  the pituitary
from the third di rat contained more antidiuretic
activity than could be due to oxytocin.
antidiuretic responses to extracts of
pituitary and hypothalamus from this
rat resembled those produced by arginine
vasopressin.  this pituitary appeared to
contain about 1/100 the normal amount of
vasopressin.  since vasopressin can inhibit
diuresis in these di rats, it would appear
that they have a specific deficiency of
endogenous arginine vasopressin.

familial renal diabetes insipidus.
renal diabetes insipidus has been known
for 20 yr. only.  the first german report
on such a case appeared in 1957.  nevertheless
this disease appears to be more
frequent, also in germany.  a report is
given on 4 infants from 2 families with a
verified diagnosis.  in the one family there
were 3 other cases with the features
of the disease (polydipsia, polyuria, low
sg of the urine).  in the other family
anamnestic studies revealed 5 such cases.

evaluation of 20 years' experience with the treatment of hydrocephalus
in infants.
a total of 394 infants were examined between
1943 and 1962.  till 1961, 369 infants
were examined and 246 were operated on (66.7%);
this group is analyzed.  laurence's
opinion on the favorable spontaneous
evolution is not agreed to and the
merits of surgical treatment are proved.  a
dynamic form of hydrocephalus in
operated infants is shown; the patients who
were not operated on suffered from other
diseases combined with macrocephaly which
must be distinguished from hydrocephalus.
a spontaneous arrest of the process
was observed in only 14 children, e.g.
3.8%, as compared with laurence's 42.6%.
the cause and pathological findings are
analyzed in 102 infants operated on between
1957 and 1962.  a great discrepancy
between the time of the onset of first symptoms
and the time of operation was found.
this disease manifests itself in 50% of infants
in the first month of life, but the average
age of infants at the time of operation is
6.1 mth.  only 3% of infants are operated
on in the first month.  thirteen operating
procedures were used in the 20 yr. under
review.  until the introduction of deviation of
the csf into the jugular vein or into
the cardiac atrium, 15.33% of the infants
survived 1 yr. after operation.  since the
introduction of this procedure the survival
rate of infants was 67.8%.  in spite of
the late operation about 27% of surviving
children showed an average mental
development.  surgical treatment of dynamic
hydrocephalus is advocated.  they
consider this method as the only means of helping
the infant at present.

cerebrospinal fluid dynamics in the arnold-chiari malformation.
a method using radio-iodinated serum albumin
to measure the volume of the ventricular
system, and the rate of disappearance
of csf from the lateral ventricles, has
been described.  newborn infants with a rate
of flow less than 70 ml. /24 hr. after
surgical repair of the myclomeningocele
will develop progressive hydrocephalus
requiring a ventriculo-atrial shunt.  the
test can be used to detect the patency of a
ventriculo-atrial shunt, and may allow safe
removal of the shunt in selected patients.

coexistent cranial and spinal defects with hydrocephalus in five
infants.  the etiology and significance of craniolacunia in these
defects.
the clinical, roentgenographic and etiologic
factors in 5 infants with varying cranial
defects (craniolacunia and craniofenestra
or cranial meningocele), hydrocephalus,
and spinal defects (meningocele or myelomeningocele)
are described.  all of the
infants expired of bacterial complications.
the etiologic factors and significance
of cranial defects in these coexistent
malformations of the central nervous system
are reviewed.
.I 962
.W
hydrocephalus and myelomeningocele.  central nervous system infection.
a series of 38 incidents of cns infection
in 34 patients with hydrocephalus,
myelomeningocele, or both have been summarized.
gram-positive organisms occurred
more frequently and caused infections
resulting in a mortality of 33%.  the gram-negative
organism induced infections
resulted in a mortality of 60%.  nearly 50% of
the infections occurred in patients before
any shunting procedure was done.  the
staphylococcus caused two-thirds of the
infections in patients with a shunt in situ.
no obvious portal of entry could be
demonstrated in a majority of patients.  of 5
patients who received nonspecific prophylactic
therapy because of an oozing
myelomeningocele 4 survived.  of the 5 given
no prophylactic therapy, one survived.  a
combination of kanamycin, sodium
methicillin, and chloramphenicol appeared in
vitro to be effective against most of the
gram-positive cocci.  the combination of
chloramphenicol, kanamycin, and
polymixin b appeared in vitro to be an effective
combination against most of the gram-negative bacilli.
.I 963

myelomeningocele and hydrocephalus.  the first year of 50 patients.
fifty infants with hydrocephalus and
myelomeningocele were treated comprehensively
by a team of specialists.  patients
were evaluated at death or the first birthday,
whichever occurred first.  twenty
patients died, 13 from bacterial infection.
thirteen of the survivors were classified
as noncompetitive, that is, were thought
to have a poor prognosis based on a
developmental quotient of less than 80.  seventeen
patients were judged competitive; in
each case the latest developmental quotient
was more than 79 and the urinary tract
was not irreversibly decompensated.
developmental quotient was based on motor
development, adaptive behavior, language
development, and personal-social development.
this report is a progress report
in a longitudinal study.  in comparison
with a previously surveyed group the results
seem encouraging: current data from 39
older patients followed 6 to 13 yr. show
2 competitive survivors, 11 noncompetitive
survivors, and 26 deaths.
.I 964
.W
pneumoencephalographic changes in the cavum septi pellucidi and their
clinical significance.
the pneumoencephalographic appearances and
clinical problems associated with
communicating and non-communicating cavum
septi pellucidi are discussed on the
basis of 11 cases.  non-communicating csp
may lead to intermittent headaches due
to variations of intracranial pressure and
obstruction to the flow of csf.  in rare
cases, representing a special etiological
group, the foramina of monro and the
aqueduct may be narrowed.  a communicating
csp is generally associated with mild
to moderate symmetrical internal hydrocephalus.
in the author's opinion this is in
most cases a direct result of the cavum, since
fluid continues to be formed in the
cavum after communication with the rest of
the ventricular system has been established.
the conditions resemble those in
hypersecretory hydrocephalus.  for these
reasons the author rejects the view that a
communicating csp is of no clinical
significance.  in some cases the possibility of a
combination of a cavum with a cerebral
malformation must be considered.
.I 965
.W
posterior scalloping of vertebral bodies in uncontrolled hydrocephalus.
two cases of extensive posterior scalloping
of the vertebral bodies are presented
in men aged 17 and 23 years, having
long-standing hydrocephalus.  two
additional cases with scalloping of only one
lumbar vertebra when partially controlled
hydrocephalus has been present for a shorter
time are also noted.  no previous
association between these entities has been
recorded.  it is supposed that the increased
intraspinal pressure which must have
been present in the first 2 patients for
many years, was present near the time of
closure of the epiphysis at the junction of
the arch and the bodies and caused not only
widening of the spinal canal but also
excavation of the vertebral bodies.  scalloping
of vertebral bodies has been described
in: (1) neoplasms (neurofibromas,
meningiomas, gliomas, hemangio-endotheliomas,
hemangiomas, lipomas): (2) intraspinal
cysts (intradural arachnoid cysts,
tarlov's perineural cysts, thoracic extradural
cysts in kyphosis dorsalis juvenilis):
(3) congenital anomalies of the spine and
cord (fusion defects, myelodysplasia,
hydromyelia, absence of a single vertebral
pedicle, meningoceles): and
(4) neurofibromatosis (with or without a thoracic meningocele).

electroencephalographic picture of the infantile hydrocephalus.
in 50% of 33 cases of congenital hydrocephalus
the eeg examinations were normal.
asymmetry of the eeg recording was the
most common abnormality encountered
both in congenital and in acquired hydrocephalus.
none of the children examined
revealed any focal neurological symptoms.
it is concluded that eeg examinations could
be useful in differentiating congenital from
acquired hydrocephalus, because a normal
eeg recording suggested the congenital
nature of the condition.

consecutive hydrocephalus.  report of 2 cases.
two patients, each with 3 consecutive hydrocephalic
newborns, are reported.  consanguinity

fanconi's anaemia with hydrocephalus and thyroid abnormality.
a case is described in a girl who suffered
from dwarfism due to congenital hypoplasia
of the pituitary and from other congenital
malformations.  the pancytopenia
manifested itself at the age of 2 yr. and was
resistant to a combined corticosteroid-testosterone
treatment.  unusual findings in
this case were congenital hydrocephalus,
hypoplastic spleen, and hypoplasia of thyroid
together with persistently high pbi
serum levels but without apparent changes
in thyroid function.

dandy-walker-taggart 'syndrome' (a case report).
dandy-walker-taggart 'syndrome' in a
6-month-old girl has been substantiated by a
correlation of clinical and pathological
features.  all 3 exit foramina of the 4th
ventricle have failed to open, resulting in
severe cystic dilatation of the ventricle and
hypoplastic distortion of posterior midline
cerebellar structures.

hydrocephalus due to smallpox occurring in the fetal period.
out of 450 cases of hydrocephalus in the years
1959-1962, 15 were found whose mothers
had contracted variola after the 3rd
month of pregnancy.  based on these personal
cases and the sparse data in the literature,
the clinical, epidemiological,
radiographical (skull), biological and histopathological
aspects are presented (2 fatal
cases were histopathologically examined).
it could be demonstrated that the hydrocephalus
occurred as a manifestation of a disease
involving the fetus and was caused
by a variola infection during gestation; inferences
are given from the eeg and examination
of the liquor.

air-pantopaque ventriculography in congenital hydrocephalus and
myelomeningocele.
a study of the csf pathways by combined pantopaque-air
ventriculography in infants
with congenital hydrocephalus and myelomeningocele
is presented.  the advantages
of this method are discussed.  combined pantopaque
and air ventriculography provides
not only a demonstration of the extent of
the hydrocephalus but also the exact
location and cause of the obstruction.  in infants
with myelomeningocele it permits
the disclosure of unmanifested hydrocephalus
and coexistent intracranial malformations.
the early detection of the latter is very
important for the complete evaluation,
management and prognosis.  the introduction
of pantopaque into the ventricular
system of infants did not produce an immediate
reaction and did not precipitate
deterioration of the clinical status.  retention
of small amounts of pantopaque in the
lateral ventricles did not interfere with the function
of bypassing procedures.
.I 972
.W
two cases of dandy walker's syndrome.
dandy walker's syndrome refers to a particular
kind of malformative hydrocephaly
characterized anatomically by association with
a more or less considerable agenesis
of the cerebellar vermis and with an imperfection
of the foramina of luschka and magendie.
the dysgenetic nature of this picture is
obvious, but the pathogenesis of the
hydrocephaly is not simple and the etiology remains
obscure.  the malformation is
compensated more or less quickly in the life of
the subject.  the clinical picture is
that of a hydrocephaly by a tumor of the posterior
fossa.  the diagnosis can and must
be carried out by x-ray examination, the ventriculographic
images being pathognomonic.
the extreme ease of surgical restoration of
the passage of flow and the effectiveness
of timely operation emphasize the interest
of this syndrome, which turns out to
be a rare kind of curable malformative hydrocephaly.
the authors report 2 unpublished
cases in respect of 3-yr.-old children.  the first,
already going back several years
(1945) had unfavorable postoperational results.
the second (1962) recovered completely,
without sequelae, after resection of the
posterior wall of the cyst.

incidence and treatment of post-meningitic hydrocephalus in the newborn.
the incidence of meningitis in the first
few weeks of life is higher than in any comparable
period of life, even if cases associated
with spina bifida cystica are excluded.
the gravity of the prognosis even since
the introduction of many powerful antibiotic
drugs has been frequently emphasized.
among the 7 cases which occurred in a maternity
unit, 5 eventually made a complete
recovery.  in a group of 19 infants who developed
postmeningitic hydrocephalus and
were referred either with still active meningitis
or the postmeningitic state, only 1
infant could not be treated by a ventriculocaval
shunt.  this infant and 4 others died
later.  of the 14 survivors, 7 recovered
without sequelae, in spite of extreme hydrocephalus
which was demonstrated by air
studies before operation.  the degree of
hydrocephalus, no matter how severe, is no
contraindication to operation.

method.  infection rate was found to be the
same (2.5%) by both methods, and 5
students harbouring infection were found to
be positive by both methods.  infestation
rate in the concentration method was
higher being 14 per slide against 4 per

a polyethylene tube culture method for the diagnosis of parasitic
infections by hookworms and related nematodes.
studies were made in amami island and in
bangkok to compare the diagnostic efficiency
of direct microscopical examination,
test tube culture and the newly devised
polyethylene tube culture method for the detection
of filariform larvae.  the results
show that the new technique has a number of
advantages over the other methods.  it
is more sensitive than the others for the detection
of cases of slight infection and
greatly reduces the risk of overlooking small
numbers of larvae.  polyethylene tubes
are extremely cheap, compact and light, and
can be very easily disposed of after
use.

some observations on the effects in vivo of varying ambient temperatures
on filarial worms of snakes.
new information was obtained on the biology
of filarial worms from experiments
using constrictor constrictor mexicanus
boas, infected with macdonaldius oschei
worms.  the microfilariae of m. oschei are
aperiodic with respect to the light cycle,
but fluctuate sharply in density from day
to day.  maximum minimum levels occur
approx. 2 days apart.  the microfilariae
are larger and more variable in size on
the days of maximum density than on the
days of minimum density.  it is suggested
that the smaller microfilariae on the days
of low parasitemia are those that have
been born recently and that they enlarge
during the following 48 hr. before they enter
the peripheral capillaries.  low ambient
temperatures have little effect upon m.
oschei.  exposure of the host to ambient temperatures
above 36 c for a period of
24-48 hr. appears sufficient to kill adult
m. oschei.  all microfilariae apparently die
within 144 hr. at this temperature, and in
slight infections.  they disappeared from
the blood altogether within that period.  microfilariae
from an infection 20 times
more severe, however, were not eliminated
from the circulation prior to the death
of the host after 288 hr., although all those
observed were either decomposed or
distorted and apparently dead.  the indication
that the temperature serves as a limiting
factor for the parasite at a point several
degrees lower than that postulated for
the host species, is probably correlated
with the nocturnal habits of the host.

pathology of schistosoma japonicum in the taiwanese monkey
(macaca cyclopis).  i.  comparison of formosan and japanese strains.
ii.  effect of passing the formosan strain through japanese snails.
i.   nearly equal recovery rates of adult worms
from taiwanese monkeys (macaca
cyclopis) infected with formosan or japanese
strains of sch. japonicum were recorded.
worm recovery rates from the monkeys
were low when comparison was
made with the highly susceptible laboratory
rabbit, signifying only partial susceptibility.
formosan strain granulomas in
the liver contained fewer eggs but
were considerably more severe and extensive
than japanese strain granulomas.
the possibility that the large, atypical granulomas
could be reactions to young,
degenerating formosan worms is discussed.
an alternative hypothesis to explain
the dissimilar reactions, that formosan strain
eggs are stronger tissue irritants
than those of the japanese strain, is proposed.
ii.   the formosan strain of sch. japonicum
was passed through the japanese snail
intermediate host (oncomelania nosophora)
for 4 consecutive generations.  progressively
rising rates of snail infection and
mortality were recorded.  the resultant
laboratory strain of formosan schistosome
was used to infect taiwanese
monkeys.  monkeys infected with the natural
formosan strain and natural japanese
strain served as controls.  worm recovery
rates were similar in the 3 groups.
granulomatous responses in the liver produced
by the laboratory strain were compared
with the large atypical granulomas of
the natural formosan strain and the
conventional granulomas of the natural japanese
strain.  the new formosan strain
appeared altered toward characteristics possessed
by the japanese strain.

an evaluation of the bentonite flocculation and indirect
hemagglutination tests for the diagnosis of filariasis.
the indirect haemagglutination test and the bentonite
flocculation test utilizing a
saline extract of dirofilaria immitis have been
evaluated.  the test was reactive
with sera from individuals with infections of
acanthocheilonema perstans and showed
higher titres for symptomatic patients with
microfilariae in the blood.  in a group
of 42 symptomatic patients, 92% of 13 microfilariae-positive
patients and 62% of 29
microfilariae-negative patients showed positive
serologic tests.  in a group of 15
asymptomatic individuals with microfilariae
in the blood, 67% were positive.  from
a group of 295 asymptomatic microfilariae-negative
individuals, 21 sera (7%) were
positive.  testing 632 sera from 295 normal
missionaries, 84 normal americans,
and 253 individuals with various other parasitic
and bacterial infections, an overall
non-specific response of 10% was obtained,
utilizing the following criteria for a
positive serologic test: (1) haemagglutination
titre of 1:200 or higher with a positive
flocculation of 1:5 or higher, or (2) a haemagglutination
titre of 1:400 with a negative
flocculation reaction.  sera from 141 patients
with helminth diseases showed a non-specific
rate of 21%.  this high rate was due
to cross-reactions with trichinosis
sera (35%), schistosomiasis (20%) and ascariasis (27%).
since the schistosomiasis
and ascariasis sera were from individuals born
in an area endemic for filariasis,
the reactions may represent a serologic response
to past experience with filariasis.
only 5% of 112 sera from individuals with non-helminthic
diseases and 5% of 84
sera from normal individuals were positive.

filariasis in mountain province, luzon, republic of the philippines.
an endemic focus of w. bancrofti in mountain
province, luzon (calaccad valley),
is discussed.  an 11% microfilaremia rate
was found.  the parasites were probably
brought into this area in the original human
migration, as recent immigrants came
from non-infected areas.  no infection was
found in children under 12 yr. of age,
which correlates with spraying of the area
since 1953.  however, some people live
in unsprayed houses, and children may
become infected.  with coming road development
and urbanization, culex p. fatigans
will move in and undoubtedly increase
transmission.  currently anopheles minimus
flavirostris is the most important
local vector.  aedes (finlaya) niveus was
probably also a vector.

immunological studies on filariasis.  iii.  isolation and purification
of antigen for intradermal skin tests.
an antigen for intradermal skin tests was
extracted from the homogenate of dirofilaria
immitis with a phosphate buffer at
ph 7.2 and purified by sephadex g-100 gel
filtration, cm-cellulose chromatography and
deae sephadex a-50 column chromatography.
the finally purified antigen, fscd1,
was a protein with a small amount of
carbohydrate (2.5%) and gave a relatively
broad band by electrophoresis on cellogel
film.  the aminoacids detected by high-voltage
paper-electrophoresis of the acid
hydrolyzate of the antigen were lysine, arginine,
glycine, alanine, glutamic and
aspartic acids, and valine.  wheals and an
erythema appeared within 15 min. of the
injection of the antigen 0.05 , on proved filariasis
patients.  cross reactions were
examined in patients with p. westermani,
s. japonicum, hookworm, a. lubricoides
or e. vermicularis, but only weak skin reactions
were noticed in all cases.  the
protein nature of the antigen was further proved
by the fact that proteolytic enzymes

immunological studies on filariasis.  iii.  fractionation and
purification of antigen for intradermal skin reaction in filariasis.
it had been reported that the antigen tca
obtained from adult worms of dirofilaria
immitis produced noticeable reactions in
filariasis patients in whose blood microfilariae
could be demonstrated.  further fractionation
and purification of this antigen
was attempted in order to study the
substance responsible for the skin
reaction and to obtain a more reliable
antigen with high sensitivity and specificity.
the fraction fs obtained by treatment
similar to that described in
the previous report was used as parent material.
by gel-filtration and sephadex
g-100 column chromatography of antigen fs,
antigen fsi, which produced noticeable
reactions in the filariasis patients,
was obtained.  this highly reactive antigen
fsi was separated into 6 fractions, viz.fsc-1,
fsc-2, fsc-3, fsc-4, fsc-5 and
fsc-6, by cm cellulose chromatography.
the 6 antigens were tested at the 1
(protein component) level on patients infected
with wuchereria bancrofti.  antigen
fsc-4, containing 1,500 of protein and
40 of carbohydrate per ml., was
most active.  next, the further fractionation
of antigen fsc-4 by deae-sephadex
a50 column chromatography was carried
out to yield 4 antigens, viz.fscd-1,
fscd-2, fscd-3 and fscd-4.  the 4 antigens
were tested at the 0.05 (protein
component) level on filariasis patients. antigen
fscd-1 produced the most noticeable
skin reaction in the patients.  the elimination
of protein components from antigen
fscd-1 was attempted with nagase (a proteolytic enzyme)
and pronase to obtain
antigens fscdn and fscdp.  each of
these 2 antigens was tested on the patients
proved to have filariasis, but the reaction
produced by the injection of each antigen
was weaker than that produced by antigen
fscd-1.  it may be inferred from these
studies that the substance responsible for
the skin reaction is proteinic.

identification of canine microfilariae.
the importance of microfilarial identifications
in diagnosing canine filariasis was
emphasized by comparing the significance of
infections due to different species.
personal experiences and an analysis of published
reports found the modified knott
method to be the simplest and most practical
of the reliable methods.  its usefulness
was improved by new morphologic criteria for
differentiating microfilariae.  microfilarial
concentrations in peripheral blood from
a number of naturally infected dogs
were determined.  the average count for 44
dogs infected with dirofilaria immitis
was only 24,430 (range: < 50 to 168,350) per
ml. of blood compared with an average
of 235 (range: < 50 to 2,450) per ml. for 100
dogs infected with dipetalonema reconditum
only.  of 38 dogs with inapparent infections
of d. immitis, 17 had microfilarial
concentrations within the range found for infections
of d. reconditum only.  male and
female dogs with d. reconditum had similar
concentrations of microfilariae.

chemotherapy of metastatic gastro-intestinal cancer.
   cancer of the digestive tract is the commonest
cause of death from neoplastic disease in the united
states.  a large number of patients with these forms of
incurable cancer may be candidates for specific anti-tumor
drug therapy.  the criteria employed for the selection
of patients for systemic or regional chemotherapy
are reviewed and methods of treatment are outlined.
systemic chemotherapy, using fluorinated pyrimidines,
the antifol, methotrexate, and the alkylating agent, cytoxan,
has been found to be of significant practical value
in 10 to 30% of the patients receiving these anticancer
drugs.  protracted hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy
in patients with primary and secondary hepatic neoplasms
and tumors of the biliary system has resulted in
objective tumor response and associated clinical benefit
in 60% of the patients treated.  length of survival has
been prolonged in patients with advanced metastatic liver
cancer from primary tumors of the colorectum.  it is
concluded that systemic and regional cancer chemotherapy,
in selected cases, has contributed to the practical
management of patients with incurable cancer of the
gastrointestinal tract.

intra-arterial infusion emphasizing treatment of malignant neoplasms.
this review of the english medical literature
summarizes most of the significant
papers concerned with intra-arterial infusion.
this technique of cancer therapy is
effective for palliation of many advanced primary
and recurrent cancer patients.
head and neck cancer patients form the largest
group of patients that have been treated
because of the easily accessible arteries.
however, almost any involved organ
can be infused by external approaches to the
femoral, brachial and common carotids.
most oncolytic chemotherapeutic agents can
be given via the intra-arterial route at
notably increased dosages with the exception
of 5fudr.  partial and complete regression
of many tumors can be obtained with
present day chemotherapeutic agents
for 1 or 2 mth.  the best therapeutic results
have been in patients with head and neck
and pelvic tumors.  currently infusion techniques
using small mobile pumping units
permit the patient to be ambulatory during course
of anti-tumor therapy.  complications
from intra-arterial infusion are usually
minor but serious complications do
occur such as embolic phenomena to the cns
with internal carotid infusion; aplastic
bone marrow from drug toxicity, hemorrhage
from tumor degeneration.  technical
complications of the infusion may not be life
threatening but frequently prematurely
terminate the therapy.  continued interest in
this form of therapy appears inevitable.

intra-arterial chemotherapy for cancer metastatic to liver.
twenty-two patients with cancer metastatic
to the liver were treated by the intra-arterial
infusion of cancer chemotherapeutic
agents.  the drugs were introduced
directly into the hepatic artery in 10 patients
and into the aorta to the level of the
celiac axis in 12 patients.  no significant differences
in results were observed in the
2 groups.  of the 10 patients who received cancer
chemotherapy via the hepatic artery,
one remains alive 2 mth. after treatment;
3 died in the immediate posttreatment
period; 7 survived from 1-17 mths after
treatment, an average survival of
6.1 mth.  all 12 patients who were treated by
the intra-aortic administration of cancer
chemotherapy have died; 3 patients died
in the immediate posttreatment period; the
survival time of the remaining 9 averaged
3.7 mth.  an objective significant shrinkage
of the metastases in the liver was
observed in 6 patients (3 treated by the intra-hepatic
artery route and 3 via the aorta);
this lasted from 1-10 mth.  subjective palliation
was observed in 12 patients (5
treated by the intrahepatic artery route and 7
by the intra-aortic route).  the major
complication noted was leukopenia; to a lesser
degree, hepatic failure.  in those patients
with poor metabolic reserve and in
those who had received chemotherapy,
irradiation or both in the immediate past,
the complications were severe.  the need
for critical screening for the proper selection
of patients as candidates for cancer
chemotherapy is discussed.

cancer chemotherapy by continuous intra-arterial infusion.  experience
of the veterans administration surgical adjuvant cancer chemotherapy
infusion study group.
two hundred fifty-one patients with advanced
cancer have been treated with 365
courses of intra-arterial cancer chemotherapy.
this technique and its complications
and results are analyzed and discussed.
objective response was obtained in
57% of the patients treated.  the best results
were obtained in epidermoid carcinoma
of the head and neck and the poorest
in primary brain tumors and intra-abdominal
adenocarcinomas.  ten per cent
of all patients receiving at least 1 course
of therapy and available for evaluation obtained
worthwhile palliation for 6 or more
months.  ten patients have had satisfactory
results for periods of 12 to 28 months.
it is concluded that arterial infusion
chemotherapy may be of benefit in
the palliation of patients in whom other more
conventional methods have failed or
are contraindicated.  the frequency of serious
complications suggests that at present
this form of therapy should be used only
by individuals and groups with special
interest and experience in chemotherapy.
much further study of this type of cancer
treatment is needed and various areas of
investigation are suggested.

treatment of cancer by bacterial toxins.
the initial experience with toxin therapy for
sarcoma and melanoma is reported in
3 groups of patients: toxins used as an adjunct
to operation in potentially curable
patients, palliative treatment for metastatic
tumor and toxin therapy supplemented
by radiotherapy for localized symptomatic
tumor masses.  the experience has not
been encouraging in the first 2 groups.  in 6
of 8 patients in the 3rd group there was
marked objective remission of tumor subsequent
to irradiation.  further study is
indicated in the use of radiotherapy following
'priming' with bacterial toxin injections.

radiotherapy of malignant rectal and anal tumors.  methods and results
in 271 cases.
the results are given of the treatment of
271 patients (9 cases of anal and 262 of
rectal carcinoma) with conventional deep
therapy and ultrahigh kilovoltage irradiation.
the total 5-year survival rate
was 14%.  with surgical treatment it is,
according to a survey of the literature made
by reifferscheid, 19.9%, according to
guleke 20-25%, and according to ottenheimer
21.3%.  a total of 39 patients
received irradiation after questionable radical
surgery, and 11 patients received
palliative irradiation after palliative surgery
(in most of these cases an anus praeter
was performed).  altogether 48 patients
received palliative irradiation without
surgery, and 45 patients received irradiation
because of recurrence after apparent
radical surgery; 11 patients received irradiation
because of metastases after apparent
radical surgery and 6 patients because
of metastases after palliative surgery.
ultrahigh kilovoltage radiation treatment
showed better results than conventional
deep therapy.  irradiation with 1,200-1,600 r.
on the site before surgery in stage
c cases gives higher 5-year survival rates,
according to dukes (henschke;stearns et al.).

the management of advanced cancer.
patients with incurable cancer may receive
substantial relief of disabling mental
and physical symptoms by constant and continuous
medical management.  while usually
of limited value, certain measures of
both specific anticancer therapy and
nonspecific supportive therapy may relieve
the symptoms and sustain the patient's
morale.  general supportive measures
of value and the various cancer chemotherapeutic
compounds and techniques of
administration of these drugs are reviewed
from the standpoint of patient selection,
practical application to various
forms of cancer, and limitations of these agents
in patients with advanced cancer.

evaluation of ileal conduit as a palliative procedure.
during the 6.5 yr. period ending july 1963,
107 ileal conduit operations were performed
at the city of hope medical center in
the treatment of carcinoma of the bladder
and other pelvic organs.  the character
and extent of the lesions are described
in detail.  the details of the surgical procedure
are discussed.  complications including
pyelonephritis, uremia, enteric and urinary
fistulas, wound infections, and thrombophlebitis
were common.  twenty-eight of the
107 patients died during the postoperative
period.  fifty-nine of the 79 surviving
patients are known to have died, mostly
as a result of recurrent, uncontrollable carcinoma.
the procedure was considered
palliative in 39 patients.  in 12 of these patients
the lesion was removed and the conduit
established in one stage; 2 patients died.
in only 1 of the surviving 10 patients
was the tumor under control.  the average term
of survival was 8.5 mth.  the procedure
was carried out in 2 stages in 4 cases;
2 patients died after the 2nd stage.
the 2 surviving patients lived 1.5 and 4 3/4 mth.,
respectively.  an ileal conduit
alone was established in 23 patients, 8 of whom
died after the operation.  the average
time of survival was 4.5 mth.; 1 patient
was alive after 11 mth.  it is concluded
that an ileal conduit in conjunction with total
cystectomy in 1 stage is indicated as
a palliative procedure but only when severe intractable
symptoms exist and only when
patients are carefully selected.  the procedure
is poorly tolerated in older persons.

cancer chemotherapy by continuous intra-arterial infusion of
methotrexate.
continuous intra-arterial infusions of methotrexate
were used in the treatment of
45 patients with malignant disease of the
head and neck, 16 patients with advanced
cancer of pelvic organs, and 7 with malignant
lesions of the lower limb.  in 4 patients
with epidermoid lesions of the head
and neck there was complete regression
of the local tumor.  thirty-three other patients
benefited from treatment for varying
periods of time, but the remaining 30
showed no response.  eight patients died
during or immediately after treatment; all
had advanced cancers of the head-and-neck
region.  the mean total dose of methotrexate
given in the patients with no response
was significantly less than in those
with partial regression of the tumor.
this suggests that the greater the total dose
of methotrexate tolerated, the greater
the chance of beneficial response.  the role
of continuous intra-arterial chemotherapy
in the management of malignant disease
is discussed.

management of advanced ovarian carcinoma.
the life graph is presented for the purpose
of illustrating the results of treatment
for patients with ovarian carcinoma who
eventually died from their disease.  it includes
all patients regardless of initial stage
of disease, histology of the tumor, or
therapy employed.  the series is a selected
one because of the type of patient referred
to the medical oncology service, and
it demonstrates that almost 2/3 of the patients
died within 2 yr. of diagnosis.  all
patients received active, aggressive anti-tumor
as well as supportive therapy, although
there was no formal protocol for patient
management.  it might be possible, employing
a standardized therapeutic approach-irradiation
when indicated to the entire
abdomen in the dose range of 3,500
rads, followed by judicious use of currently
available anticancer drugs when the
disease recurs-to produce a modest increase
in the 2-year survival figures.  since
most series show that approximately 75%
of patients with ovarian carcinoma are in
stage iii of iv when first diagnosed, more
attention might be directed to earlier
diagnosis.  while it is an important field for
investigation, methods of facilitating
early diagnosis are not apparent at the moment.
controlled trials of adjuvant therapy
for stage i and ii disease in which approximately
40% of recurrences are seen
should be expanded.  this might consist of
instillation of radioactive or chemical
agents into the abdominal cavity, the use of
systemic chemotherapy during or immediately
after operation, or infusion of drugs
into the abdominal aorta.  for stages
iii and iv controlled trials of drugs alone,
sequentially, or in combination with or
subsequent to irradiation seem indicated.
finally, efforts to find more effective
anticancer drugs must continue.

liver resections for embolic metastases from cancer of the colon and

   two patients, who underwent resections of the
left lobe of the liver for embolic metastases from primary
cancers of the colon and rectum, are reported.
the internal anatomy of the liver, as it relates to the
technic and terminology of resections, is reviewed.
cases of liver resection performed for embolic metastases
from cancer of the colon and rectum, found in an
extensive review of medical literature, are classified
and the results are analyzed.  resection of either half
of the liver (hemihepatectomy) for embolic metastasis
from cancer of the colon or rectum, so rarely cures
the patient and carried such a high operative mortality
rate, that it is seldom, if ever, justifiable.  the lesser
operations (left lobectomy or right-lobe metastasectomy)
often can be performed simultaneously with the primary
operation and are occasionally followed by freedom from
recurrence for periods of 5 yr or more.  they are justifiable
if the metastasis is situated favorably in the liver
for complete removal, and if the primary lesion appears
to be curable.

congenital extrahepatic biliary atresia.  a successful operated case on
ductus hepaticus obstruction.
the author briefly reviews the history and
the anatomical manifestations and the
genesis of congenital extrahepatic biliary atresia,
and its associations with other
abnormalities.  he collected 957 cases in the
literature from ladd's first successful
operated case up to the end of the year 1961.
in publications he found 177 theoretically
correctable cases and 124 which were
recovered.  in 1 of 2 personal cases
he performed successfully a hepatico-duodenostomy
in a 7-week-old girl.  four
years later the girl had developed normally
and she was absolutely without symptoms
and signs.  the author, discussing the
differential diagnostic problems, stresses
the diagnostic value of the gradually increasing
direct serum bilirubin, proposing
the term 'ex juvantibus differentiation' alluding
to the differential diagnostic evaluation
of the time which passes until the surgical
exploration; he also emphasizes the
need of early-latest up to the age of 8 weeks
performed-surgical exploration.
according to him the administration of vit. k
is advantageous.  he supposes the cause
of the postoperative dehiscence of the operative
wound lies in the metabolic changes
as a result of icterus.  the author in his own
case, the relieved drainage of the
bilio-digestive anastomosis solved by the help
of a polyethylene nasal tube and
which could be most safely removed by the
surgeon.  with statistical data of other
authors and personal cases, the author points
out that the correctable cases occur
in 19.8% of all the cases.  one may hope for
successful operations on an average
in 10.2% of all the cases and 50.8% of the correctable
ones.  fatal complications,
the author believes, can be reduced by early surgery.

icterus neonatorum simplex.
studies in 50 guinea-pigs demonstrate that at
birth there is no activity of glucuronyltransferase.
after birth activity gradually
increases and reaches its highest
level on the 3rd day of life.  hereafter a gradual
decrease can be shown.  the suggestion
is made that glucuronyltransferase is
an adaptive enzyme.  the results
support the hypothesis that neonatal jaundice
is caused by an inability of the liver
of the newborn to excrete bilirubin.
.I 1006
.W
the importance of steroid hormones in hyperbilirubinemia, and icterus
of the newborn.
administration of naturally occurring steroids
(estriol, pregnanediol, cortisone)
between the 7th and the 11th day of life increases
the bilirubin level of these newborns.
administration of the same steroids
or of progesterone to nursing mothers
results in hyperbilirubinemia of their infants.
these facts explain the pathogenesis
of neonatal jaundice.  interpretation of the
experimental and clinical findings leads
to the conclusion that the high amount of
steroid hormones which must be excreted
during the neonatal period in conjunction
with the relative insufficiency of the neonatal
liver is responsible for the inability
to conjugate bilirubin with glucuronic acid.
the steroid hormones probably compete
with bilirubin for the enzyme and substrate
necessary for conjugation.  the functional
capacity of the neonatal liver is
not high enough to conjugate both bilirubin
and steroids.  only after excretion of the
placental steroids does sufficient conjugation
of bilirubin become possible.  furthermore,
pregnanediol appears to inhibit the
enzyme glucuronyl transferase.  these
mechanisms show the importance of steroid
hormones in the pathogenesis of neonatal
jaundice and their importance as an
aggravating factor in the development of
jaundice due to erythroblastosis.  these newly
developed concepts may have therapeutic
implications on which the author will
report at a later date.

problems in neonatal obstructive jaundice.
a critical analysis of 57 cases of neonatal
obstructive jaundice led to the conclusion
that proper diagnosis can be determined
by study of liver biopsy.  the very
low percentage of surgically correctable lesions
among patients with neonatal obstructive
jaundice and the seriousness and
high mortality of the cases of hepatitis
treated with a hazardous operation are stressed.
conservative management is recommended
until 3 mth. of age and even later
if a serial fall in bilirubin is noted.

clinical study and histological study of the liver in hepatitis in
infants.  i.  classification and findings of clinical study and
histological study of the liver in hepatitis in infants (japanese).
clinical observations and histological studies
by liver biopsy on hepatitis in infancy,
i. e. obstructive jaundice of unknown cause in
infants, were made.  histologically,
hepatitis in infancy was divisible into 3 types:
(1) no giant cell formation was observed.
in general, slight degeneration of liver
cells, necrosis and inflammatory
changes with stasis of bile were characteristic.
(2) the so-called giant cell hepatitis
was characteristic.  (3) specific type, presenting
the picture of cholangiolitis.
histological changes in the liver other than biliary
stasis were scanty.  no specific
changes which could clinically differentiate the
3 types were found.  in each type,
serum bilirubin, sgot and sgpt activities had
slight characteristic points in clinical
and laboratory studies.  in type 1, the values
were relatively low, while in type
2 they were markedly high.  in type 3, sgot activity
was within normal range.  histological
characteristics of the liver of type 1
were necrosis of liver cells, formation
of acidophilic granules and balloon cells,
cellular infiltration in glisson's capsule,
and biliary stasis in the liver cells and
fine bile ducts.  morphologically, findings
of viral hepatitis were observed.  in type
2 liver tissue was replaced by many
multinuclear giant cells.  extreme distortion
of cords of liver cells and cellular infiltration
in glisson's capsule and lobules were
noted.  there was marked biliary
stasis in the capillary bile ducts and liver cells.
it was characteristic that proliferation
of bile ducts and bile plugs were not found,
which was consistent with giant
cell hepatitis of craing-landing.  in type 3, degeneration
of liver cells, necrosis
and inflammatory changes were slight.  biliary
stasis in the hepatic lobules was conspicuous.
histological findings similar to cholangiolitic
hepatitis due to drug poisoning
were observed.

the pathology of 'giant cell hepatitis' in early infancy.
a 1-month-old male infant was admitted to
hospital because of acute cardiac and
circulatory failure.  autopsy revealed macronodular
liver cirrhosis with splenomegaly,
left ventricular dilatation of the heart,
hydrothorax, and ascites.  histology
of the liver showed a giant cell hepatitis.  the
portal areas were widened, with foci
of erythropoiesis and histiocytic infiltrations.
the liver cells showed vacuolar and
degenerative changes.  the giant cells, present
in the margin of the regeneration
areas, as well as in the degenerated lobules
has irregular borders and varied in
size from 45-60 ft.  their nuclei were large,
sometimes bizarre.  their basophile
cytoplasm showed granules of iron pigment
which was also found in some normal
hepatic cells, in the prominent kupffer cells
and in the connective tissue.  in the
spleen there were proliferation of connective
tissue and scattered areas of erythropoiesis,
as well as pigment deposits in the pulpa.
iron pigment was also found in the
pancreas and salivary glands.  the islets of
langerhans were hyperplastic.  the etiology
of giant cell hepatitis is still unknown.
its pathogenesis may be due to a malformation,
immunologic response to some type
of antibody, inborn errors of iron
metabolism and viral infection.  it is suggested
that the giant cell transformation is
a response of the immature liver cell to a variety
of stimuli.  this case is of interest
for the predominance of giant cells with 1 or
2 nuclei, presumably it is an intermediate
stage or a variant of hepatitis.

the surgery of infantile obstructive jaundice.
the results of suruga-yamazaki's procedure
in 14 cases of congenital biliary duct
atresia are reported.  postoperative anorexia,
diarrhea, or edema due to circulatory
disturbance in the upper extremity have
not been found after this operation.  the operation
is technically difficult.  postoperative
fat, protein, and electrolyte metabolism
is a problem.  in order to obtain better
results this disease should be differentiated
at an early period.  a long-term follow-up
and continued study of this problem
is required.

transient familial neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.
a syndrome of transient familial neonatal
unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due
to known causes has been described in 24
infants of 8 unrelated, healthy caucasian
mothers.  four of the infants developed
kernicterus.  beginning in the 2nd trimester
of pregnancy, sera from the 8 mothers
and their newborn infants inhibited direct-reacting
bilirubin and o-aminophenol glucuronide
formation by rat liver slices and
homogenates, respectively, 4 to 10 times
more than was observed with sera from
a control group of pregnant women and
their infants.  the serum inhibitory factor
in these women is unidentified.  the fact
that the inhibitor occurs in pregnancy
serum suggests that it is probably a progestational
steroid that inhibits glucuronyl
transferase activity in the liver of neonates.
the mechanism responsible for increased
serum inhibitor factor activity
in these women is unknown and requires
further study.

neonatal hepatitis: liver biopsy findings and clinical features.
on 22 infants with a clinical diagnosis of neonatal
hepatitis, histologic examination
of the liver was made by needle biopsy and
its relation to the clinical course was
investigated.  histologic findings were classified
provisionally into 3 types: type i
showed no giant cells but only slight damage
to hepatic cells with prominent intracellular
cholestasis; type ii was characterized
by occurrence of numerous giant
cells; the specific type was characterized by
centrolobular cholestasis without inflammatory
reaction.  laboratory examinations
revealed that increases in serum
transaminases and bilirubin were greater in
type ii than in type i, and in the specific
type there was no increase in serum transaminase
but there was a direct hyperbilirubinemia.
as to histologic sequelae,
the results of serial biopsy revealed that
in type i hepatic damage healed almost completely,
and that in type ii giant cells
disappeared within 1 yr and, in some cases,
hepatic cirrhosis resulted.  the prognosis
of neonatal hepatitis may be said to
be good in type i, poor in type ii, and
undetermined in the specific type.

spherocytic anemia with early deglobulisation crisis and avitaminosis a.
from birth, 2 homozygous male twins had
had a series of hemolytic crises.  these
caused a low crythrocyte count and jaundice
on the one hand, and xerophthalmia,
probably owing to the existence, proven by
liver biopsy, of a complicating obstructive
biliary syndrome, on the other.

neonatal hepatitis or familial neonatal obstructive jaundice?.
four siblings all of whom were boys with
chronic obstructive jaundice are described.
the onset of the jaundice varied from 1 day
to 4 weeks after birth.  two other boys
and 2 girls in the same family are healthy.
although in one of the 4 cases pathological
findings were the same as in neonatal hepatitis
('giant cell hepatitis'), other possibilities
could not be excluded.  what has been
described hitherto as giant cell hepatitis
appears to be only a morphological picture,
for which there must be several causes.
it is concluded from the findings in the 4 patients
that one of the possible causes of
so-called giant cell hepatitis is an inborn
error of metabolism.

hypoplasia of the intrahepatic bile ducts.
a description of 2 cases: (1) a boy of 13 days
old had atresia of the small intestine
and pneumonia, and a slightly enlarged liver
with faint green coloration.  histological
examination revealed numerous collapsed
bile ducts which had solid ductular
cell sprouts reaching the liver cells;
the minor and smallest bile ducts were
empty.  (2) a girl of 1 yr and 4 mth had increasing
jaundice since birth.  autopsy
revealed a hypoplastic common bile duct,
which was, however, open to probing,
and marked green coloration of the liver.
also in this case, the bile ducts were
very narrow and had solid ductular cell sprouts
reaching the liver cells.  this
type of bile duct corresponds to a stage in
ontogenesis and does not show signs
of proliferation.  it may be considered a form
of hypoplasia, as the size and number
of the primordial bile ducts is reduced.  when
present the anlage shows a regular
connection with the liver cells.  this hypoplasia
is to be distinguished from an
atresia.  the long survival of the second case
can be explained by the great
compensatory capacity of the liver.

fetal and neonatal hepatitis and its consequences.
the author reports on 18 fatal cases observed
in infants from 3 weeks to 1 year old.
in all cases, jaundice appeared just after birth
or during the first days of life, and
was persistent.  the stools were sometimes
discolored.  there was no blood incompatibility.
the picture was similar to that
of congenital biliary atresia.  pathological
study revealed 2 groups: (1) with pathological
changes of hepatitis (11 cases).
the liver is enlarged, flabby and icteric.  microscopy
shows dissociation of the cell
cords and polymorphism of the hepatic cells
(necrotic cells, balloon cells, giant cell
transformation).  some of the giant cells show
vacuoles, erythrocytes, lipids and
acidophilic material in their cytoplasm.  there
are signs of regeneration, collapse
of the stromal framework, proliferation of the
mesenchymal cells and bile retention.
cells of the erythrocytic series are scattered
in the periportal spaces with eosinophilic
leucocytes, lymphocytes and histiocytes.
(2) with fibrosis and cirrhosis (7
cases).  the liver is green, firm, with a nodular
or granular surface.  the extra-hepatic
biliary tree is normal.  the spleen is
enlarged.  microscopy shows bile stasis,
pericholangiolitic fibrosis, and proliferation
of bile ductules.  the periportal, interlobular
and intralobular fibrous tissue is increased,
and shows cellular infiltrations.
the architecture of the liver is disturbed by
the presence of pseudolobuli in the regeneration
areas.  it is suggested that these cases
are due to a congenital viral hepatitis,
which is not only the result of an intrauterine
infection, but also a feature of
fetal hepatitis, with secondary pericholangiolitic
or post-necrotic liver cirrhosis.
the neonatal giant cell hepatitis is to be considered
as the result of a cytotoxic action
of the virus.  the author considers also
the possibility of a viral etiology in
cases of biliary atresia on the basis of their
morphological similarity with congenital
viral hepatitis.

metabolism and excretion of bilirubin c in experimental obstructive
jaundice.
   bile duct ligation was carried out in a series of
rhesus monkeys.  the time required for the serum bilirubin
to stop rising and achieve a relatively stable level,
and the average serum bilirubin reached, paralleled closely
that seen clinically.  after the serum bilirubin levels
had stopped rising and a 'steady state' had been reached,
radioactive bilirubin was injected i.v.  the radioisotope was
distributed principally extravascularly and not in the same
ratio as albumin, as in other forms of jaundice.  daily turnover
of bilirubin was found to be double that anticipated
from normal hb breakdown, suggesting increased bilirubin
production in obstructive jaundice.  in animals followed for
2 wk nearly 80% of injected radioactivity was excreted in the
urine, indicating that in obstructive jaundice the kidney
takes over entirely from the liver the function of bilirubin
excretion.

major surgery on the severe hemophiliac, lessons in management.
three cases of pseudotumor of the thigh which
required surgical amputation and one
case of open pericardial drainage for cardiac
tamponade are briefly reported in severe
hemophiliacs.  in the first case hemostasis, following
amputation, was produced, but the
patient died of septicemia secondary to proximally
infected tissues; the level of amputation
should, therefore, be proximal to all grossly
infected tissues.  in the second case, with
infected massive pseudotumor of the left thigh,
5 separate operative procedures were
performed.  the last procedure was elective revision
of skin flaps at the hip disarticulation
site.  here application of the knowledge gained
from previous experience resulted in a completely
uncomplicated postoperative course by
dint of timing of the surgical procedure
in relation to control of infection, loss of plasma
fastness, and the judicious use of antibiotic
and direct-current electrocoagulation therapy.
a plea is made to avoid the use
of plasma and ahg therapy in hemophilias
for trivial reasons and to consider patients
for surgical procedures early in the course of their
complications, which demand surgery,
at a time when the patient is still responsive
to hematologic therapy and prior to the
onset of infection in areas of hematoma.  it is
felt that a second significant hemorrhage
in any particular site constitutes a bona fide
indication for surgical intervention, long
before the time when surgery is considered as
the last resort by the physician, patient and
family.  although the authors believe that surgery
in the hemophiliac is not to be taken
lightly, they do not endorse the prevailing nihilistic
attitude that has resulted in temporizing
delays which can only guarantee a fatal outcome.

immunological demonstration of factor viii protein in the plasma of
hemophiliacs and its value for an insight into hemophilia a.
by immunization of rabbits one obtains antisera
against human factor viii, the action
of the immunsera has been determined using
a modification of the thromboplastingenerations
test (the factor viii neutralization
test).  the antibodies against factor viii
are equally absorbed by either normal or hemophilia
a plasma.  this observation shows
that hemophilia a plasma contains as much factor
viii protein as normal plasma does.
in normal and hemophilia a serum one finds
at a lower level similar concentrations of
factor viii.  in analogy with cross-reacting substances
(crm) in bacteria mutants an
hypothesis has been made according to which
the authors are dealing with the product
of a genetically altered synthesis of factor viii.
this product is functionally less active
but possesses the same antigenic determinants
as the normal factor viii.  some inhibitor
properties of the hemophilia plasma can be
explained by competitive inhibition made
possible by the similarity of structure.  the fact
that the inhibitor discovered by mammen
and factor viii have similar properties support
the hypothesis.  the theory of some
authors according to which the plasma of an
hemophiliac a contains normal amounts
of a normal factor viii blocked by a specific
inhibitor, the pathogenetic agent of hemophilia a
is rejected because of genetic considerations
and because the accelerator appearing
after ether treatment of hemophilia a plasma is
not identical with factor viii.

haemophilic pseudotumours (3 cases).
the 2 first cases of haemophilic pseudo-tumours
in 2 adults affected with haemophilia
a reported are remarkable on account of their
clinical latency and their intertrochanteric
localization.  the third, in a haemophiliac b, is
very extensive and is accompanied by very
marked clinical symptoms of tumour.  there is
an extensive femoral gap with a subjacent
image of osseous infarction and a progressive
turgid tumour of the iliac wing of the
same side.  the literature data stress the discrepancy
between the progressive character
of this veritable tumour and the absence of
any sign of histological malignancy.

protein-losing enteropathy complicating prolonged bleeding in
hemophilia.
gastrointestinal bleeding in a severe hemophiliac
continued for 110 days, and 263
pints of fresh blood were replaced.  treatment
with eaca, steroids, and factor
viii, rich fibrinogen did not control bleeding.
marked hypoproteinemia developed
by the 94th day of bleeding.  a protein-losing
enteropathy was suspected on the basis
of x-ray findings of mucosal thickening and
altered motility.  discontinuance of
steroids and protein replacement resulted
in the appearance of a more normal
small bowel mucosal pattern and coincided
with the cessation of bleeding.

a case is presented in which bilateral pseudotumors
of the calcaneus and cuboid in
an 11-year-old boy with apparent classic
hemophilia responded promptly to deep x-ray
therapy with relief of pain and subsequent
disappearance of the tumors without
recurrence for 2 yr. and 8 mth. after treatment.
although previous reports on the
effects of radiotherapy for pseudotumors
have been conflicting, the results in this

some bone lesions in the course of blood diseases with special reference
to the formation of bony callus and to the treatment of fractures in
patients suffering from blood diseases.
after some preliminary remarks on the embryology
and physiology of the bone
marrow and on the mechanism of coagulation
of the blood, the authors pass on to
a consideration of the genesis of bony callus,
and the treatment of fractures in
patients suffering from blood diseases.  an
account is given on the basis of some examples
of pathological fractures, and also
of some traumatic fractures in subjects
affected by various kinds of blood diseases
such as solitary myeloma, polyosteotic
plasmocytoma, waldenstroem's syndrome,
the coagulopathic syndrome
from a structural defect of the fibrin coagulum,
and hemophilia.  fractures in patients
with blood diseases are characterized
by an abnormal course, and, for an
effecient cure, it is necessary to make an
accurate diagnosis with regard to the
pre-existing blood diseases and to re-establish
hemostasis when this has been
changed, to prevent hemorrhages, and to correct
any plasma defect that may be
present and which are reflected in the formation
of the bony callus.

studies of the antihemophilic factor (ahf, factor viii) produced in von
willebrand's disease.
it has been confirmed that persons with autosomal
ahf deficiency (von willebrand's
disease) produce large quantities of
ahf when transfused with ahf-deficient
plasma from persons with hemophilia a.
this occurs despite the fact that
'complementation' does not occur in vitro.  one
prediction from a model suggesting
that the x-locus for ahf is structural while
the autosomal locus is regulatory is
that the ahf which appears in von willebrand's
disease after transfusion will be
structurally normal.  the ahf obtained under
these conditions has been tested by
methods and the results fulfil the prediction.
this may imply that the model is
correct.  on the other hand, the prediction may
have been fulfilled for other
reasons.  perhaps the wrong parameters were
examined, or the large standard
errors of the tests masked a real difference.
further tests are obviously needed
before one can feel reasonably certain that
mutation of a regulatory gene is the
basis of von willebrand's disease.  an examination
of persons with sex-linked and
autosomal ahf deficiency using an antibody
prepared against wild type ahf might
be very illuminating.  also, transfusion studies
should be carried out on persons
homozygous for von willebrand's disease if
such persons can be found.  failure
to obtain 'new synthesis' in a homozygote would
throw great doubt on a model which
implies that the reduced ahf levels in von
willebrand's disease heterozygotes is
due entirely to reduction in an effector substance
which neutralizes the repressor
of an x-chromosome operon directly coding
the ahf molecule.

concurrent hemophilia and christmas' disease in one family.
a study is presented of a number of generations
of a family in whom two members had
christmas' disease and three hemophilia a.
it is suspected that the preceding generations
must have been afflicted with hemophilia
ab, or a mutation in x-chromosome genes
which are responsible for both types of hemophilia
must have occurred in the grandmother's
family.  in her daughters the genes
responsible for hemophilia ab segregated
so that their children and grandchildren inherited
only one type of hemophilia i.e. hemophilia
a or christmas' disease.  relevant genetic
considerations are briefly reviewed.

major surgery in classic hemophilia using fraction i.  experience in
twelve operations and review of the literature.
   a therapeutic regimen that provides hemostasis in
hemophiliacs during and after major surgery without requiring
laboratory control has been established with a
factor viii concentrate.  the effectiveness of this regimen
of fraction i therapy was evaluated in major surgery
of 6 severely deficient and 4 moderately deficient hemophiliacs.
an analysis of clinical results was made, combining
the 12 operations of the series with the 116 major
operative procedures on hemophiliacs recorded in the
english literature, in which fraction i was the sole or
major source of factor viii therapy.  dental and nondental
surgery were analyzed separately, as was the
special problem of blood cysts.  although the over-all
mortality rate following major surgery in hemophiliacs
is presently only 5 to 10% using factor viii concentrates,
problems still remain.  these include the continued high
incidence of abnormal postoperative hemorrhage, the
variation in factor viii potency of different lots of fraction
i, the late development of serum hepatitis, hemolytic
anemia due to contaminating isoantibodies and the
high cost of adequate amounts of the product.  more efficient
methods of preparing purer and more potent factor
viii concentrates could eliminate most of these difficulties.

lengthening of the thrombin time by an anti-equine antithrombin in a

   a report is given on a patient treated with numerous
i.m. injections of thrombase (equine thrombin) for
chronic gingivorrhagia caused by a hyperthrombocytic
myelosis.  these were ineffective and an antithrombin
specific against equine thrombin had developed.  this
did not cause any specific disturbance of the intrinsic
coagulation.  the observation can be compared with two
cases of haemophilia where such an antithrombin had
also developed after repeated injections of equine thrombin.

epsilon-aminocaproic acid (e-aca) as a therapeutic agent based on 5
years clinical experience.
   experience in the treatment of 744 patients with
e-aca suggested that the use of the preparation is indicated
in the following situations: (1) fibrinolytic haemorrhage
in association with delivery.  (2) acute systemic
fibrinolysis in association with surgery.  it is
mainly major operations on the thorax, pancreas, prostate,
liver and genital organs that are complicated by
fibrinolysis, but fibrinolytic bleedings can occur after
any operation.  (3) acute systemic fibrinolysis in patients
with cancer, particularly cancer of the prostate
and pancreas.  (4) systemic fibrinolytic states complicating
various disorders, especially leukaemia, liver
cirrhosis and boeck's sarcoid.  (5) as an antidote in
thrombolytic therapy.  (6) local fibrinolytic activity
in the urinary tract in the following situations: (a)
after prostatectomy.  e-aca will substantially reduce
blood losses following prostatectomy, especially if the
treatment is continued until the urine has become macroscopically
clear.  (b) haematuria in prostatic cancer,
prostatic hyperplasia, prolonged haematuria after traumatic
injury of the kidney, haematuria in haemophilia and
other coagulation defects, and so-called essential haematuria.
(7) ulcerative colitis.  the drug is equally effective
whether given orally or intravenously.  in states
with increased systemic fibrinolytic activity a dose of
0.1 g per kg body weight every 4-5 hours is recommended.
for inhibition of local fibrinolytic activity in
the urinary tract, a dose of 3 g three times a day has
proved sufficient.  the side-effects consisted of dizziness,
nausea and diarrhoea.  no toxic effects of the drug on
e.c.g., blood picture, n.p.n. and liver function tests
were observed, not even in cases receiving more than
1000 g of e-aca.  nor did postmortem examination in
46 cases reveal any signs of a toxic effect.  no signs of
intravascular coagulation in connection with e-aca
therapy were observed.  the incidence of thromboembolic
complications after prostatectomy in patients
treated with e-aca and a series of controls was identical.
judging from the authors' experience in this material
e-aca did not act as an agent inducing thrombosis.

femoral neuropathy in hemophilia.
   six new cases of femoral neuropathy in hemophilic
patients are described.  the syndrome begins with severe
pain in the groin, in the inferior aspect of the thigh,
and deep in the hip region.  this is followed by a pronounced
contracture of the hip in flexion and external
rotation.  a tender swelling appears in the iliac fossa and
groin with a depression in the center corresponding to
the inguinal ligament.  finally, a flaccid paralysis of
the quadriceps femoris and diminution or absence of sensation
in the anteromedial aspect of the thigh and proximal
portion of the leg, with a depressed or absent
patellar reflex, is discovered.  the authors propose that
this syndrome is the result of hemorrhage in the iliopsoas
muscle at the musculotendinous junction beneath
the iliacus fascia and that the femoral nerve becomes
compressed beneath the unyielding inguinal ligament
superiorly and the iliopectineal ligament medially.
treatment consists in bed rest, analgesics, and freshfrozen
plasma during the acute phase.  during the convalescent
phase, a hessing long brace is used to protect
the knee from hemarthrosis until functional return
of the quadriceps femoris has occurred.  to date, the
validity of the theory that the femoral-nerve palsy is
the result of iliopsoas hemorrhage at the musculotendinous
junction and compression of the femoral nerve beneath
the inguinal ligament has not been verified.  the
authors anticipate some day seeing a non-hemophilic patient
with a traumatic iliacus hemorrhage and femoral
neuropathy.  should such an opportunity present itself,
exploration beneath poupart's ligament may show the
femoral nerve to be compressed and thus confirm the
proposed cause of the clinical picture.

hemorrhagic episodes in hemophilia: a 5-year prospective study.
   medicosocial studies of hemophilia are of
particular clinical importance in allowing an assessment
of the likely course of the disease at different
ages and for differing grades of severity, and in
providing knowledge of which complications cause
the most disability, loss of education, and earning
capacity.  they also overcome the distorted clinical
impression of the disease which arises from the
recurrent admission of the same few severely affected
hemophiliacs.  owing to the considerable individual
variation in the number and severity of complications
in different hemophiliacs an accurate individual
prognosis can never be given.  in general,
however, the number of spontaneous episodes per
year decreases with age, while the severity of individual
episodes tends to increase, at least until
the age of 21 yr.  there is general agreement that
the bulk of hospital hemophilic admissions are due
to hemarthroses and that hemophilic arthropathy
involves the knee more than it does any other joint.
the increased time spent in hospital per episode in
later life is in part at least due to the development
of relatively unstable weight-bearing joints due to
hemophilic arthropathy and associated muscle atrophy.
thus the correct management of individual
hemarthroses in childhood is of considerable importance,
and at the present time too little is known
of the best possible treatment for these episodes.
little is known of the pathological mechanisms of
hemophilic arthropathy and whether it is the presence
of blood or its presence under tension which
leads to joint destruction.  thus opinions differ concerning
the routine admission of all hemarthroses
to hospital regardless of severity and also about the
advisability of joint aspiration in an attempt to avoid
the development of destructive arthropathy.  because
of the individual variation between patients, the
changes in the pattern of the disease with age, and
the difficulty of obtaining suitable control patients
these questions can be answered only by further
longterm prospective medicosocial studies.
